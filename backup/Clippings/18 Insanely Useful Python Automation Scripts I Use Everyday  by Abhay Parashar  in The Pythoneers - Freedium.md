#### Automation scripts you need to try (Collection) — Part 2

I've been using Python for almost 5 years now, and the one thing that continues to attract me and drive my research is its ability to automate tasks. Over the past year, I've been diving into Python's automation capabilities and have come across some amazing packages, facts, and useful scripts. In this blog, I'll share a collection of daily automation scripts that have significantly boosted my productivity and performance.

> *This is* ***part 2*** *of my Automation scripts collection,* **check out the** **[part 1](https://medium.com/pythoneers/17-mindblowing-python-automation-scripts-i-use-everyday-523fb1eb9284)** **here**.

### 1\. Pomodura

The Pomodoro Technique is one of the simplest methods for improving productivity. It's based on breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks (5 minutes).

This Python automation script enhances the Pomodoro Technique by adding a Forced device lock once the timer runs out, ensuring you take the much-needed break.

### 3\. TrendyStocks

*There's a saying: "What's seen sells."*

In the stock market, perception can be as powerful as the numbers. Smart investors know it's not just about the figures, but the stories, the news, and the buzz shaping the market.

When a stock is trending — whether for good or bad reasons — more people talk about it, and more articles are written about it. This growing chatter can offer valuable clues for making smarter buy or sell decisions.

This automation script taps into Google Trends to create a graph for any stock you're interested in, giving you insights into its popularity and helping guide your investment strategy.

### 5\. ClockWork

Time tracking helps you uncover patterns, optimize workflows, and stay accountable. It's a key tool for turning your efforts into measurable progress and ensuring every minute counts.

Manually tracking tasks and time can quickly become overwhelming. Remembering start times, calculating durations, and maintaining logs disrupts your workflow and introduces room for error. The outcome? A productivity tool that turns into just another task on your list.

This automation script eliminates these headaches with a simple, intuitive solution. It automates the tracking process, allowing you to set custom task durations, monitor progress in real-time, and automatically generate detailed logs, so you can focus on what truly matters.

### 8\. WordCounter

There is a famous line from the web series [BoJack Horseman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398228/) — "Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day — that's the hard part. But it does get easier".

One of the best pieces of advice that I have ever gotten in my initial days of Blogging is to write regularly a certain amount of words. However, there was no cheaper or simpler way to track how many words I had written in a day. This automation script works as a life savior by keeping track of the number of words I have written in a day and motivating me once I reach my daily milestone.

### 10\. HeaderSpy

Email headers are crucial metadata components of an email that reveal important details about its origin, transmission, and content. Although they're not visible to the recipient by default, you can view them using email client features or specialized tools. These headers contain various fields, each serving a specific function.

They play an essential role in the smooth operation of email systems, helping to authenticate messages and provide transparency about the sender. Email headers are instrumental in preventing spam, verifying the sender's identity, and troubleshooting delivery issues.

If you've never seen an email header, trust me — it's far from easy on the eyes. This automation script extracts key information from email headers, helping you determine whether an email is spoofed, bounced, or potentially malicious.

Email lists are the lifeblood of online engagement, where each subscriber is a valuable member of your digital community. They form the core of successful digital marketing, connecting you directly with your audience.

As a digital influencer, maintaining constant engagement with your followers is key — but doing it manually can quickly become overwhelming, and the cost of third-party tools can drain your budget.

### 13\. ExifClean

Exif (Exchangeable Image File Format) is a standard that defines the formats for images, sound, and additional tags used by digital cameras, smartphones, scanners, and other devices that handle image and audio files captured by digital cameras.

The Exif data, embedded within the image file, holds crucial metadata such as camera settings, date and time, geolocation, image orientation, software information, camera model, and more.

If you're someone who loves sharing your memories through images on social media, this script is a must-have for you.

This automation script allows you to input an image path, extracts all the Exif metadata, and then removes it completely — helping you protect your privacy while still sharing your photos with ease.

### 14\. BugBuster

Writing clean, efficient code isn't just a good practice — it's essential for building scalable, maintainable projects. Yet, ensuring code quality can feel like an uphill battle, especially when you're working with large codebases or tight deadlines. The process of spotting vulnerabilities, linting issues, or logical inconsistencies can quickly become overwhelming without the right tools.

### 15\. Port Scanner 🔍

Let's talk some cyber security!!

In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint that allows different processes or services to connect and exchange data over a network. Ports are identified by numerical values and are associated with specific protocols.

Open ports are like windows or doors in a building — each one provides a potential entry point for communication between a website and external networks. However, leaving ports open without proper security measures in place can leave a website vulnerable to cyber attacks.

This automation script will take a website URL as input and check for any open ports in that website. Whether you're running the show as part of the Red Team or holding down the fort on the Blue Team, this script can serve as a useful handy tool for you.

Let's scan **itsecgames.com**, *an extremely buggy web app!*

### 16\. Readme Generator

A README.md file is the first impression of your project — it provides key details and encourages others to dive deeper into what you've created. While it's one of the most important files in your repository, crafting it can often be a time-consuming task.

This automation script changes that by quickly generating README.md files based on simple inputs like repository names, links, and project descriptions. Save valuable time and focus on what matters most: building your project.

### 17\. SmartTrading 😎

A stock's price indicates its current value to buyers and sellers. Traders around the world spend most of their time looking at different line, bar, point, figure, and candlestick charts to analyze and make decisions to buy to sell particular stocks. However, people who work 9 to 5 or 12 to 12 (WFH guys) usually don't have time to keep looking at these dashboards.

Buying premium membership in many trading companies is a way to get notified once stock prices go down below a threshold, but it will cost lots of money. There is a much simpler, easy, and cheaper way (cost 0$) that I will show you using Python. This automation script helps you track stock prices and get notified once the price drops down to a certain threshold percentage.

### 18\. VoiceNotes

In our fast-paced world, capturing ideas or reminders on the go is essential. Voicenotes are a great way to quickly record thoughts, to-do lists, or creative ideas hands-free. However, managing them can be a hassle, with cluttered storage and missed files.

This automation script simplifies the process by automatically creating, organizing, and saving your Voicenotes, so you never have to worry about losing or searching for them again.
