Okay, the user wants a tutorial to learn Helix, the text editor. Let me start by recalling what Helix is. It's a modal editor like Vim or Kakoune, but with some differences in keybindings and features. I should structure the tutorial step-by-step, starting from installation to basic usage and more advanced features.

First, I need to cover installation. Helix might not be in all package managers, so I should mention different methods: downloading binaries, using package managers like Homebrew or apt, or building from source. Then, verifying the installation with the 'hx --version' command.

Next, the basics of modal editing. Helix has modes: normal, insert, and select. I should explain each mode briefly. Maybe a table comparing modes and their purposes. Important to note that the default is normal mode, which is for navigation and commands.

Then, basic navigation. Movement keys like h, j, k, l, but also other keys like w, b, e for word navigation. Arrow keys might work, but it's better to stick to the home row. Also, combining with modifiers like Ctrl for page up/down.

After navigation, editing commands. How to enter insert mode (i, a, o, etc.), delete lines, undo/redo. Mention the different ways to enter insert mode and their cursor positions. Maybe some examples: pressing 'i' to insert before the cursor, 'a' to append after.

Then saving and exiting. Commands like :w, :q, :wq. Also, handling crashes and recovery files if possible.

Moving on to more advanced topics: selection and multiple cursors. In Helix, you can select text and use commands on selections. Maybe explain how to expand selections with Alt-up/down. Also, using s to select next occurrence, S for all occurrences. Multiple cursors can be created by splitting selections, which is a powerful feature.

Configuration. The config file location (~/.config/helix/config.toml). Basic settings like theme, line numbers, etc. Maybe an example of setting the theme to "monokai" and enabling line numbers. Also, mentioning key remapping if needed.

Plugins and language support. Helix uses Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting and LSP for code intelligence. Users might need to install LSP servers separately. Examples like installing pyright for Python, rust-analyzer for Rust. How to check if LSP is working.

Custom keybindings. How to modify the config.toml to add keybindings. Maybe an example of adding a keybinding to Ctrl-s for save.

Tips and tricks: using :sh to run shell commands, surround functionality (like adding quotes around a selection), and macros.

Finally, resources for further learning: official documentation, GitHub repo, communities like Reddit or Discord, and practice advice.

I should make sure the tutorial is structured logically, starting from installation, then basic usage, then more advanced features. Use headings to separate sections, code blocks for commands and keybindings, and maybe some examples. Keep the language clear and concise, avoiding jargon where possible. Also, check if there are any recent changes to Helix that might affect the tutorial, but since I'm using my knowledge up to 2023, it should be okay.

Wait, Helix's keybindings are more similar to Kakoune, right? So maybe mention that for users coming from Vim. Also, the selection-first approach is different from Vim's verb-first. Important to highlight that difference to avoid confusion.

Also, need to mention that Helix uses space as the leader key in some contexts, or maybe not? Let me confirm. In normal mode, pressing space brings up the command menu. So space is like the leader key here. Maybe include that in the basic commands section.

For the configuration part, the config.toml structure is important. Users might want to set their theme or adjust the editor's behavior. Including an example config snippet would help.

In the plugins section, clarify that Helix doesn't have a plugin system like Vim, but relies on Tree-sitter and LSP. So users need to set up LSP servers properly. Maybe a note on how to configure LSP in the config.toml if necessary.

Troubleshooting: if LSP isn't working, check if the server is installed and in PATH. Mention common issues like that.

Overall, the tutorial should guide a new user from installation to being comfortable with the basics and aware of advanced features. Make sure each step builds on the previous one, and provide practical examples. Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate for clarity.
