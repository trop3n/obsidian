- **Why use Neovim?**
- Lightweight, fast, and highly customizable.
- Ideal for developers and power users.

### **2\. Basic Navigation**

- **Modes in Neovim** :
- Normal mode (`Esc` or `Ctrl-[`): For commands.
- Insert mode (`i`, `a`, `o`): For editing text.
- Visual mode (`v`, `V`, `Ctrl-v`): For selecting text.
- Command mode (`:`): For running commands.
- **Movement Commands** :
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`: Move left, down, up, right.
- `w`, `b`, `e`: Move by words.
- `0`, `$`: Go to start/end of line.

- `:bnext`, `:bprev`: Switch buffers.
- `:sp`, `:vsp`: Split windows horizontally/vertically.
- `gt`, `gT`: Switch tabs.

### **5\. Configuration Basics**

- **Init File** :
- Located at `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` (or `init.vim` for legacy setups).
- **Keybindings** :
- Example: `nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR>` (save file with `<leader>w`).
- **Plugins** :
- Managed via package managers like `packer.nvim` or `lazy.nvim`.
