I still remember the time, when I just wrote a Python script in which I had to process a large dataset. It was a small project but for processing that much data, I had to wait…wait..wait for a long time.

The task that could be done in a few minutes is dragged into hours.

Then, I realized something was wrong. My code was not optimized, so I learned to optimize my code after a lot of attempts. **It makes my script speed up by 300%.**

Let's understand step-by-step — what I did.

### 1\. Profile Your Code First

First of all, we have to figure out, which part of the code is causing the slowness. But we don't have to guess that part.

In Python, we can use `cProfile` , which helps to understand which part of the program is taking the most of the time.

Let's understand, how I use it:

```python
import cProfile
def my_script():
    # Your code here
    pass
cProfile.run('my_script()')
```

It will give us a detailed breakdown of how much time each function is taking.

When I used **cProfile** in my script, I found that **80% of my script's runtime** was spent in just two functions. So I decided to optimize those functions.

### 2\. Use Built-in Functions

As you and I already know Python built-in functions are written in C, they will be much faster in execution than the functions that we will write in Python.

In my code, I was using a `for` loop to add the numbers in a list:

```dart
total = 0  
for num in my_list:  
    total += num
```

So, I replaced it with Python's built-in function `sum`:

```ini
total = sum(my_list)
```

This simply reduces the runtime of that part of my code by **50%**.

### 3\. Use List Comprehensions Instead of Loops

I know loops are easy to write, but not always the fastest. I have a code that creates a new list from an existing list using a **for loop:**

```python
new_list = []  
for item in old_list:  
    if item > 10:  
        new_list.append(item)
```

I replaced this code with a list comprehension:

```python
new_list = [item for item in old_list if item > 10]
```

As a result of this change, my above code becomes **2x faster.**

*But you must check this, before deciding:*

### 4\. Avoid Global Variables

I am not sure whether you know about this or not, but global variables can slow down our script as Python has to check many scopes to find the value of global variables.

I had used a global variable `counter` in a large function.

```python
counter = 0
def count_items(items):
    global counter
    for item in items:
        counter += 1
```

But then I decided to move this variable inside a function like this:

```cpp
def count_items(items):
    counter = 0
    for item in items:
        counter += 1
```

This change helps me a lot to boost some of the speed of my script.

### 5\. Replace Regular Loops with NumPy

Firstly I was using Python lists for processing my numerical data, but then I realized I must use **Numpy** for this.

For example, I had to multiply each item on the list by 2. Before Numpy, I do like this:

```python
result = [x * 2 for x in my_list]
```

When I used Numpy for it, it became like this:

```php
import numpy as np
array = np.array(my_list)
result = array * 2
```

And this Numpy version runs **10x faster** if we have large lists, as we know that Numpy is built in **C**.

### 6\. Use Generators for Large Data

In my script, I had a function that was dealing with a large dataset. I was using lists in order to store its intermediate results, which used most of the memory resulting in slowing down everything.

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1_000_000)]
```

But then I started using generators, which process items sequentially instead of all at once.

```python
squares = (x**2 for x in range(1_000_000))
```

This helps me in reducing the memory usage resulting in boosting my script.

### 7\. Parallel Processing with `multiprocessing`

My best results came when I learned about multiple CPU cores.

As you know, by default, Python runs on a single core. But if we use `multiprocessing` library, then it can split tasks across other available cores.

Let me tell you, how I did it:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
def process_data(item):
    # Your processing logic here
    return item * 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Pool() as pool:
        results = pool.map(process_data, my_list)
```

This single change gives my script a **100% speed boost** as some tasks can run in parallel now.

### 8\. Avoid Repeating Work

Previously, I had a function that was calculating the same result again and again.

```css
for item in my_list:
    result = expensive_function(item)
    print(result)
```

But then, I decided to store that result in a single variable:

```python
cache = {}
for item in my_list:
    if item not in cache:
        cache[item] = expensive_function(item)
    print(cache[item])
```

We can call this technique **memoization** and it helps me to save a lot of time.

### 9\. Optimize Imports

Previously, for using a even single function from the library, I used to import the whole library.

```java
import pandas
result = pandas.read_csv("data.csv")
```

But then, I decided to change my way, I just imported that function from the library that I require:

```java
from pandas import read_csv
result = read_csv("data.csv")
```

This method didn't just speed up my script but also helps me to reduce the startup time for my script.

### 10\. Use the Latest Version of Python

Previously, I was using the old version of Python. So I upgraded to the newer version and I saw a noticeable speed boost in my script, even without changing a single line of code.

If I can boost the speed of my script, you can also do it. Just we need the patience and willingness to experiment.

Just try these steps whenever you code next time and check whether these methods help you or not.
