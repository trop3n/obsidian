Hey everyone, Hammaz here. I’m excited to announce that I’ve passed the **CDSA (Certified Defensive Security Analyst)** exam from **HackTheBox**! I am among the first **100 cert holders.**

Cert

I’ll be giving a brief overview of the exam and sharing some tips that helped me succeed. Unfortunately, I can’t provide detailed specifics about the exam due to a non-disclosure agreement.

Firstly, the exam was **Difficult** with a capital “D”. As someone who has only been studying cybersecurity for the past eight months, I found it quite challenging. Although it’s been mentioned many times, it bears repeating: every bit of material from the SOC path is important, and it prepares you **adequately** for the exam.

One issue I encountered was that after completing a question from the SOC path, HTB does not provide a definitive explanation. I believe that feature might be available with a year-long subscription, but you should confirm this with HTB.

So, I also did my [BTL1](https://medium.com/@hammazahmed40/conquering-the-blue-team-level-1-exam-strategies-tips-and-exam-day-insights-3209824afbfd) in March 2024(which really helped me get a solid foundation), and CDSA was at least twice as difficult.

## **Tips and Recommendations:**

1 — The exam is long, **spanning 7 days**, which can definitely lead to fatigue. I dedicated two sessions of four hours each day and was able to submit my exam in 6 days.

2–Make sure to take **detailed notes**. Every step should be documented thoroughly, as you will need to explain everything in your report later on.

3 — If you find any answer by luck, try to **reverse engineer** it. (It worked for me on multiple occasions)

4 — There are not many resources for report writing, but I did read few reports from here.

5 — You need to create **two reports**. Don’t wait to start both at the same time. Finish one before moving on to the second.

6 — Do not, I repeat, do not take the 7 days for granted. It may sound like a lot of time, but believe me, it will fly by quickly..

## **Extra Materials —**

1–Another crucial recommendation I can give you is to participate in the **BOTS (Boss of the SOC)** Splunk challenges. I completed the first three versions.

2 — Master **Volatility** using the command line version; avoid relying on the GUI.

3 — Utilize [BTLO](https://blueteamlabs.online/home). For DFIR, I completed the following labs: [**SWIFT**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/swift-17217744e9)**,** [**Countdown**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigations)**,** [**Follow My Lead 1**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/follow-my-lead-0f448a5772). For Incident Response I recommend, [**SplunkIt**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/splunk-it-0aae63055a)**,** [**Midnite**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/midnite-175b216c1c)**, Cozy Bear and** [**Banker**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/banker-c7964ff8ce).

4 — I also completed the whole **SOC level 1** path from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). CDSA has many topics that collide with it. You will get enough practice for **Elastic** and **Splunk**.

5 — Hackthebox also has something called [Sherlocks](https://app.hackthebox.com/sherlocks?sort_type=asc). The labs I completed to prepare for CDSA included Brutus, **Unit 42**, **BFT**, **Noted**, **RogueOne**, and **Meerkat**.

**Pro Tip** — Try to write small **writeups**. When handling an incident response challenge, creating detailed timelines of your findings is crucial. This practice also helped me enhance my report-writing skills.

If you’re a working professional I would suggest you start your exam on Saturday morning or Friday Evening, for obvious reasons.

Lastly, don’t forget to enjoy the exam. Solving flags and being able to make sense of it in my report gave me a confidence boost. :)
