> Hey there, everyone! Google hacking, also known as Google dorking, is an exciting and eye-opening aspect of cybersecurity. It demonstrates how advanced search techniques can uncover hidden information, reveal vulnerabilities, and even identify misconfigured systems. While often misunderstood, Google hacking is a powerful tool when used ethically, providing organizations with insights into their digital footprints. By exploring its methods and applications, you'll discover how ethical hackers utilize it to bolster security and protect against data breaches. Let's dive into this fascinating topic and unlock the secrets of advanced search techniques!

#### **Introduction**

As we all know, Google operates the most widely used Internet search engine on the planet. Google crawls nearly every web page of every website and builds a massive database of all the information it gathers. Most people then use Google's database to search by keywords for articles relevant to the subject of their inquiry. Google then retrieves the most appropriate websites based on its algorithm (the PageRank algorithm, named after Larry Page, one of Google's founders), which prioritizes the articles.

What few know is that Google has particular keywords and operators that can assist you in extracting precise information from this extraordinary database. As a hacker, that Google database may yield information about potential targets that could prove invaluable, including passwords.

Let's take a look at a few of those keywords and what they do.

#### What is Google Hacking?

Google hacking leverages Google's advanced search operators to locate specific types of data within the vast amount of indexed information. Some examples include:

- Passwords accidentally exposed in text files.
- Internal documents like spreadsheets or PDFs.
- Configuration files containing sensitive information.
- Unsecured admin panels or login pages.

Originally popularized through the **Google Hacking Database (GHDB)**, these techniques have evolved into a vital part of vulnerability assessments and open-source intelligence (OSINT).

#### **Google Hacking Keywords**

Please note that Google's keywords require a colon (:) between the keyword and the search terms, such as

**intitle:samxia99**

Although far from an exhaustive list, here are some of the more widely used Google keywords:

```sql
allinanchor        If you use the allinanchor keyword, Google restricts 
                   your search to those web pages that have ALL of the 
                   terms you are looking for in the anchor of the page.

allintext          If you use the allintext keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have ALL of the search 
                   terms you specify in the text of the page.

allintitle         If you use the allintitle keyword, Google restricts your
                   search to those pages that have ALL of the search 
                   terms you specify in the title of the page.

allinurl           If you use the allinurl keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have ALL of  the search 
                   terms you specify in the URL of the page.

filetype           If you use the filetype keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have the filetype you 
                   specify. For instance, to search for an Adobe PDF file, 
                   you could use filetype:pdf

inanchor           If you use the inanchor keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have search terms you 
                   specify in the anchor of the page.

intext             If you use the intext keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have the search terms you 
                   specify in the text of the page.

intitle            If you use the intitle keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have the search terms you 
                   specify in the title of the page.

inurl              If you use the inurl keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to those pages that have the search terms you 
                   specify in the URL of the page.

link               When you use the link keyword followed by the URL, 
                   Google shows you all the sites that link back to the 
                   specified URL.

site               If you use the site keyword, Google restricts your 
                   search to the site or domain you specify.
```

#### Google Hacking Examples

Let's look at some examples of how we can use Google hacking to find relevant web sites and files.

As you know, many firms store important financial and other information in Excel files. We could use a simple Google hack that looks for the Excel filetype, ".xls" or ".xlsx".

**filetype:xls**

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*x2fus_2m-z4UfcpuGfEcBQ.png)

**filetype:xls serch on Yandx**

We can get a bit more selective and combine Google keywords to look for Excel files in government websites (by using the keyword site with the top level domain .gov) that have the word "contact" in their URL. This yields web pages that have contact lists from government agencies, a possible treasure trove for social engineering.

**filetype:xlssite:govinurl:Contact**

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*w2MfAxKt0mNe7r9cxbSlKQ.png)

**filetype:xlssite:govinurl:contect serch on Yandx**

**site:gov filetype:xls inurl:contact**

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*7FX44sTd-QfTDW0jNBGdOA.png)

**site:gov filetype:xls inurl:contact search on Yandex**

If I were looking for an Excel file with email addresses, I might use the following:

**filetype:xls inurl:email.xls**

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*_9Rq8Zlo6BByq7pPWNDNhg.png)

**filetype:xls inurl:email.xls search on Yandex**

Many PHP applications are vulnerable to SQL injection (see Chapter 12) and other attacks. We can look for these types of web applications with:

**inurl:index.php?id=**

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*CJj3_LOTBoTi9Bnj9YXTMg.png)

**inurl:index.php?id= search on Yandex**

Some other Google hacks that might yield interesting results include: **intitle:"site administration:please log in"**

If I were pursuing a social engineering attack and I want to gather useful information on my target, I might use:

**intitle:"curriculum vitae" filetype:doc**

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ar3rgc8YvPaWcDXy7I3zfQ.png)

**intitle:"curriculum vitae" filetype:doc search on Yandex**

Effectively finding unsecured web cams is one of the more fun aspects of Google hacks. The following list shows some of these effective hacks for finding vulnerable web cams:

```bash
 allintitle: "Network Camera NetworkCamera"
 intitle:"EvoCam" inurl:"webcam.html"
 intitle:"Live View / - AXIS"
 intitle:"LiveView / - AXIS" | 
inurl:view/view.shtml 
inurl:indexFrame.shtml "Axis Video Server"
 inurl:axis-cgi/jpg
 inurl:"MultiCameraFrame?Mode=Motion"
 inurl:/view.shtml
 inurl:/view/index.shtml
 "mywebcamXP server!"
```

Google dorks are innumerable and some people, such as Johnny Long, specialize in developing effective Google dorks. Long has written a couple of good books on the subject. Another good source for Google dorks is the Exploit Database at **[www.exploit-db.com](http://www.exploit-db.com./)**[.](http://www.exploit-db.com./) If you go there and click on the GHDB tab to the left of the screen, we can find the latest Google dorks.

**exploit-db**

When we click on the GHDB tab, it opens:

**Google Hacking Database**

Here we can find thousands of Google dorks. Some are more effective than others. We can be very specific about the kind of dorks we are seeking. For instance, if we were targeting WordPress websites, we could enter the keyword "wordpress" in the search window, and this site would display all the Google dorks relevant to WordPress built websites (WordPress is the world's most popular content management system for building websites). Among the many Google dorks we find here is a more complex one that combines several phrases:

```sql
filetype:sql intext:password | pass | passwd intext:usernameintext:INSERT INTO \`users\` VALUES
```

When we use this dork, we find several web sites. When we click on one, we find the following:

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*zMT3bS9GyzYw4NP7IN8sAg.png)

As you can see, we were able to find an SQL script that inserted users and passwords into a database. As we can scan through this script, we find numerous username and password pairs. These should make hacking these accounts pretty simple!

Google Hacking Summary Google hacking is a key skill that every hacker should be aware of and master. In many cases, it can yield information on our target that may save us hours, or even days, in exploiting a target. As we continue to expand on information-gathering techniques, keep in mind that you are unlikely to use all of these techniques on one project. Each project is unique, and you will need to customize your information-gathering techniques to the target. It is also important to note here that we are using publicly available information that does not require we "touch" the domain or website of the potential target and, thereby, trigger some alert by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or other security devices as we are gathering information.

In this article, I'll introduce you to more techniques for gathering information on your target from publicly available sources.

### ==Applications of Google Hacking==

1. **Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing:** Google hacking is used to locate vulnerabilities during security assessments.
