# Why use OSINT in our SOC?

1. **Threat Intelligence**: OSINT enables us to research the latest hacking techniques, real-world vulnerabilities, exploits, etc. This external threat intelligence aids us in better-securing infrastructure against modern attack vectors.
2. **Incident Response**: During security incidents, OSINT facilitates quickly gathering context around suspicious indicators like IP addresses, domains, file hashes that may be involved in an attack. This accelerates incident response and investigation.
3. **Attack Surface Mapping**: By employing OSINT, we can uncover exposed systems, open ports, technologies in use, subdomains, and other external-facing assets. This allows us to map potential attack surfaces and remediate risks.
4. **Infrastructure Mapping**: OSINT tools conveniently visualize our entire online infrastructure footprint across cloud providers, domains, networks and services.
5. **Breach Assessment**: In case of a suspected compromise, OSINT techniques help gauge impact by scouring for organization data being sold on dark web markets and other public sources.
