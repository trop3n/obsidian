# A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers

Python is a hacker's language. With its decreased complexity, increased efficiency, limitless third-party libraries, and low bar to entry, Python provides an excellent development platform to build your own offensive tools. 
## Target Audience

Beginners to Python, and advanced Programmers looking to enter penetration testing.
## Organization of the Book

The authors set out to write an evil cookbook of examples of the **darker side of Python**. The book contains recipes for penetration testing, web analysis, network analysis, forensic analysis, and exploiting wireless devices. The goal is to inspire the reader to make their own Python scripts. 
### Chapter 1: Introduction

If you have not programmed in Python before, Chapter 1 provides background information about the language, variables, data types, functions, iteration, selection and working with modules, and methodically walks through writing a few simple programs. 
### Chapter 2: Penetration Testing with Python

Introduces the idea of using the Python language to script attacks for penetration testing. 

- Port scanner
- SSH botnet
- Mass compromising via FTP
- Conficker
- Writing an exploit
### Chapter 3: Forensic Investigation with Python

Utilizing Python for digital forensics. 

- Geo-locating individuals
- Recovering deleted items
- Extracting artifacts from Windows registry
- Examining metadata in documents and images
- Investigating application and mobile device artifacts
### Chapter 4: Network Traffic Analysis with Python

Using Python to analyze network traffic. The scripts in this chapter:

- Geo-locate IP addresses from packet captures
- Investigate popular DDoS toolkits
- Discover decoy scans
- Analyze botnet traffic
- Foil intrusion detection systems
### Chapter 5: Wireless Mayhem with Python

Mayhem for wireless and Bluetooth devices. The examples in this chapter show how to:

- Sniff and parse wireless traffic
- Build a wireless keylogger
- Identify hidden wireless networks
- Remotely command UAVs
- Identify malicious wireless toolkits in use
- Stalk Bluetooth radios
- Exploit Bluetooth vulnerabilities
### Chapter 6: Web Recon with Python

Using Python to scrape web information. The examples in this chapter include:

- Anonymously browsing the web via Python
- Working with developer APIs
- Scraping popular social media sites
- Creating a spear-phishing email
### Chapter 7: Antivirus Evasion with Python

We build a piece of malware in this chapter that evades antivirus systems. Additionally, we build a script for uploading our malware against an online virus scanner.
