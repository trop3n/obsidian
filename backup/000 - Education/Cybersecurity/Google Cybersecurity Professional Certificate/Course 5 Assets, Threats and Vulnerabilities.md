>> Learn about the importance of security controls and developing a threat actor mindset to protect and defend an organization’s assets from various threats, risks and vulnerabilities.

# Module 5: Introduction to Assets

- Assets, Threats and Vulnerabilities
- Asset Inventories
- Challenges in a rapidly changing digital world
- Policies, standards and procedures
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## The What, Why and How of Asset Security

>> Security teams help companies by focusing on risk.

- Risk: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset
- Primary focus as security professionals is to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- The CIA Triad

**Security Risk Planning**

- Assets
- Threats
- Vulnerabilities

**Assets**

- Item perceived as having value to an organization
- Includes a wide range of things:
- Buildings
- Equipment
- People
- Data

**Threat**

- Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

**Vulnerability**

- Weakness that can be exploited by a threat

**Understand Risks, Threats and Vulnerabilities**

>> When security events occur, you’ll need to work in close coordination with others to address the problem. Doing so quickly requires clear communication between you and your team to get the job done.

- Risk: anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset
- Threat: any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
- Vulnerability: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat

**Security Risk**

>> Security plans are all about how an organization defines risk. However, this definition can vary widely by organization. 

- Since different organizations have particular assets that they value, they tend to differ in how they interpret and approach risk.
- One way to interpret risk is to consider the potential effects that negative events can have on a business:

**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

>> In general, risk is calculated in this field to help:

- Prevent costly and disruptive events
- Identify improvements that can be made to systems and processes
- Determine which risks can be tolerated
- Prioritize the critical assets that require attention

>> Primary focus as a security professional will be to focus on the likelihood side of the equation by dealing with certain factors that increase the odds of a problem.

**Risk Factors**

>> two broad risk factors that you’ll be concerned with in the field:

- Threats 
- Vulnerabilities

>> the risk of an asset being harmed or damaged depends greatly on whether a threat takes advantage of vulnerabilities.

**Categories of Threat**

>> Threats are circumstances or events that can negatively impact assets. There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorized as two types:

- Intentional
    
- Unintentional
    

>> Intentional threats might be malicious hackers who gain access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application.

>> An unintentional threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area.

Categories of Vulnerability

>> Vulnerabilities weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. There are a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they can be grouped into two categories: 

- Technical
    
- Human
    

>> Technical vulnerabilities may be misconfigured software that might give an unauthorized person access to important data.

>> Human vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in a parking lot. 

Common Classification Requirements

Asset Management: the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them

Asset Inventory: A catalog of assets that need to be protected

Asset Classification: the practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization

- Public
    
- Internal-Only
    
- Confidential
    
- Restricted - need to know, health info, payment info
    

Why Asset Management Matters

>> Keeping assets safe requires a workable system that helps businesses operate smoothly. Setting these systems up requires having detailed knowledge of the assets in an environment.

>> Organizations protect a variety of different assets. Some examples might include:

- Digital assets such as customer data or financial records
    
- Information systems that process data, like networks or software
    
- Physical Assets which include facilities, equipment or supplies
    
- Intangible assets such as brand reputation and intellectual property
    

>> Determining asset classifications based on sensitivity and importance of an asset typically requires knowing the following:

- What you have
    
- Where it is
    
- Who owns it, and
    
- How important it is
    

Common Asset Classifications

>> Asset classification helps organizations implement an effective risk management strategy. It also helps them prioritize security resources, reduce IT costs, and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

- Restricted is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, like need-to-know information.
    
- Confidential refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization
    
- Internal-only describes assets that are available to employees and business partners
    
- Public is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.
    

Challenges of Classifying Information 

>> Identifying the owner of certain assets is straightforward, like the owner of a building. Other types of assets can be trickier to identify. 

- Especially true when it comes to information
    
- Information can have multiple classification values at the same time
    

Assets in a Digital World

>> What exactly is valuable about an asset?

- Often information, or data
    

>> Data

- Information that is translated, processed or stored by a computer
    

States of Data

- In use
    
- In transit
    
- At rest
    

>> Data in Use: data being accessed by one or more users

- E.g. as soon as you log in to an email, it’s considered to be in use. 
    

>> Data in Transit: Data traveling from one point to another

- E.g. sending an email can be considered data in transit
    

>> Data at Rest: data not currently being accessed

- Logging out of email account, and closing laptop
    

Information Security (InfoSec)

- The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users
    
- Being mindful of new vulnerabilities as our world becomes increasingly connected
    
- Keeping track of information is part of the puzzle that companies solve when considering their security plan. Understanding the three states of data enable security teams to analyze risk and determine an asset management plan for different situations.
    

The Emergence of Cloud Security

>> One of the most significant technological developments this century has been the emergence of cloud computing.

>>  “On demand, massively scalable service, hosted on shared infrastructure, accessible via the internet”

- The adoption of cloud based services has complicated how information is kept safe online. 
    

Soaring into the Cloud

>> Availability of cloud technologies has drastically changed how businesses operate online. 

- Allows companies to scale and adapt quickly while also lowering their costs. 
    
- Introduced a range of new cybersecurity challenges that put assets at risk.
    

Cloud-based Services

>> Refers to a variety of on demand or web-based business solutions. Depending on a company’s needs and budget, services can range from website hosting, to application development environments to entire back-end infrastructure

There are three main categories of cloud-based services:

- Software as a service (SaaS)
    
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
    
- Infrastructure as a service (Iaas)
    

Software as a Service (SaaS)

>> Refers to front-end applications that users access via a web browser. The service providers host, manage and maintain all of the back end systems for those applications. Common examples of SaaS services include applications like Gmail email service, Slack and Zoom.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)

>> PaaS refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online. Developers use these resources to write code and build, manage and deploy their own apps. Meanwhile, the cloud service providers host and maintain the back end hardware and software that the apps use to operate

- Google App Engine
    
- Heroku
    
- VMware Cloud Foundry
    

  

Infrastructure as a Service

>> Customers are given remote acces to a range of back end systems that are hoste deby the cloud service provider. 

- Includes data processing servers, storage and network resources.
    
- Resources are commonly licensed as needed, making it a cost-effective alternative to buying and maintaining on premises. 
    
- Cloud-based services allow companies to connect with their customers, employees and business partners over the internet. Some examples are:
    

- Google Cloud Platform
    
- Microsoft Azure
    

Cloud Security

>>  Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications and infrastructure in the cloud.

- Responsibilities are not as clearly defined for security cloud platforms compared to on premises IT infrastructure.
    
- Apps built on a cloud platform by the customer are expected to be secured by the customer, while the servers they are hosted on have a reasonable expectation of security to be handled by the cloud service provider.
    

>> In Cloud Security, this concept is known as the Shared Responsibility Model . Clients are commonly responsible for securing anything in their control:

- Identity and access management
    
- Resource configuration
    
- Data handling
    

Cloud Security Challenges

>> All service providers do their best to deliver secure products to their customers.

- Much of this success depends on preventing breaches and how well they can protect sensitive information
    

- Misconfiguration is one of the biggest concerns. Customers of cloud-based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment. Often times, they use out-of-the-box configurations that fail to address their specific security objectives
    
- Cloud-native breaches are more likely to occur due to misconfigured devices
    
- Monitoring Access might be difficult depending on the client and level of service
    
- Meeting regulatory standards is also a concern, particularly in businesses that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR
    

Risk and Asset Security

>> Security is all about people, processes and technology

- Types of risk categories
    

- Damage
    
- Disclosure
    
- Loss of information
    

- Elements of a security plan
    

- Policies
    

- A set of rules that reduces risk and protects information
    

- Standards
    

- References that inform how to set policies
    
- Create a point of reference
    

- Procedures
    

- Step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security tasks
    

The Nist Cybersecurity Framework

>> Primary role of NIST is to openly provide companies with a set of frameworks and security standards that reflect key security related regulations.

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
    

NIST CSF Concepts

- Core
    
- Tiers
    
- Profiles
    

Five Functions of the NIST CSF Core

1. Identify
    
2. Protect
    
3. Detect
    
4. Respond
    
5. Recover
    

Tiers provide security teams with a way to measure performance across each of the five functions of the core

- Tiers range from Level-1 to Level-4. Level-1, or passive, indicates a function is reaching bare minimum standards
    
- Level-4 or adaptive, is an indication that a function is being performed at an exemplary standard
    
- Tiers aren’t a yes or no proposition, there is a range of values to determine it’s effectiveness
    

Profiles provide insight into the current state of a security plan. One way to think of profiles is like photos capturing a moment in time.

- Comparing photos of the same subject taken at different times can provide useful insights.
    

>> Good security practice is more than avoiding fines and attacks. It demonstrates that you care about people and their information.

Security Guidelines in Actions

>> Organizations often face an overwhelming amount of risk. 

Origins of the Framework

- NIST developed the Cybersecurity Framework to protect critical infrastructure in the United States. 
    

Components of the CSF

>> as you might recall, the framework consists of three main components:

1. Core
    

1. Set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan
    

1. Identify
    
2. Protect
    
3. Detect
    
4. Respond
    
5. Recover
    

3. Tiers
    

1. Way of measuring the sophistication of an organization’s cybersecurity program
    
2. Measured on a scale of 1 to 4
    
3. 1 means the lowest standard of cybersecurity controls have been implemented
    
4. 4 means the highest level of controls
    

5. Profiles
    

1. Pre made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts.
    
2. Made to address the specific risks of an organization or industry
    
3. Used to develop a baseline for CySec plans, or a way to compare plans to a specific industry standard
    

Implementing the CSF

- Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations
    

- Way of measuring how well an organization is protecting their assets
    

- Note: regulations are rules that must be follows, while frameworks are voluntarily chosen
    

>> CSF can be a challenge to implement due to it’s high level of detail

>> The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency provides detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF. This is a quick overview and summary of their recommendations:

- Create a current profile of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business
    
- Perform a risk assessment to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards
    
- Analyze and prioritize existing gaps in your security operations that place business assets at risk
    
- Implement a plan of action to achieve your organization’s goals and objectives
    

  
  

Safeguard Information

- Effective data handling processes
    
- The role of encryption and hashing in safeguarding information
    
- Standard access controls
    

Security Controls

>> Safeguards designed to reduce specific risks

- Technical
    
- Operational
    
- Managerial
    

Information Privacy

- The protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data
    

Principle of Least Privilege

- The concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function
    
- Defining the difference between data owners and data custodians
    

>> Data Owner: the person that decides who can access, edit, use or destroy their information

>> Data Custodian: anyone or anything that’s responsible for the safe handling, transport and storage of information

Principle of Least Privilege

>> a security concept in which a user is only granted the minimum level of access and authorization required to complete a task or function

- Fundamental security control that reduces risk, how it’s commonly implemented, and why it should be routinely audited
    

Limiting access reduces Risk

- Implementing the principle of least privilege can greatly reduce the risk of costly incidents like data breaches by:
    

- Limiting access to sensitive information
    
- Reducing the chances of accidental data modification
    
- Supporting system monitoring and administration
    

- Least privilege greatly reduces the likelihood of successful attacks by connecting specific resources to specific users and placing limits on what they can do. 
    

- Should be applied to any asset
    

Determining Access and Authorization

- Two questions to ask to determine access and authorization:
    

- Who is the user?
    
- How much access do they need to a specific resource?
    

- Users should generally each have their own account. These are typically managed in an organization’s directory service.
    

The most common types of user accounts:

- Guest accounts are provided to external users who need access to an internal network, like customers, clients, contractors or business partners
    
- User accounts are assigned to staff based on job duties
    
- Service accounts are granted to applications or software that needs to interact with other software on the network
    
- Privileged accounts have elevated permissions or administrative access
    

It’s best practice to determine a baseline access level for each account type before implementing least privilege. 

- Appropriate access level can change from one moment to the next. 
    

Auditing Account Privileges

>> Setting up the right user accounts and assigning them the appropriate privileges is a helpful first step. Periodically auditing those accounts is a key part of keeping your company’s systems secure.

There are three common approaches to auditing user accounts:

- Usage audits
    
- Privilege accounts
    
- Account change audits
    

Usage Audits

- When conducting a usage audit, the security team will review which resources each account is accessing and what the user is doing with the resource.
    

- Help determine if users are acting in accordance with an organization’s security policies
    
- Determines if user privileges can be revoked if they’re no longer being used
    

Privilege Audits

- Users tend to accumulate more access privileges than they need over time, an issue known as privilege creep
    
- Determine whether a user’s role is in alignment with resources they have access to
    

Account Change Audits

- Account directory services keep records and logs associated with each user. Changes to an account are usually saved and can be used to audit the directory for suspicious activity, like multiple attempts to change an account password.
    
- Most directory services can be configured to alert admins for suspicious activity
    

The Data Lifecycle

>> In security, data vulnerabilities are often mapped in a model known as the data lifecycle

- Each stage of the data lifecycle plays an important role in the security controls that are put in place to maintain the CIA triad of information
    

The Data Lifecycle

>> The data lifecycle has five stages:

1. Collect
    
2. Store
    
3. Use
    
4. Archive
    
5. Destroy
    

>> Protecting data at each stage of this process describes the need to keep it accessible and recoverable should something go wrong.

Data Governance

>> Businesses handle massive amounts of data every day. A structured approach to handling and managing all of this data is the best way to keep it private and secure

Data Governance is a set of processes that define how an organization manages information.

- Governance often includes policies that specify how to keep data private, accurate, available and secure throughout it’s lifecycle
    

>> Effective data governance is a collaborative activity that relies on people. Data governance policies commonly categorize individuals into a specific role:

- Data owner: the person who can access, edit, use or destroy their information 
    
- Data custodian: anyone or anything that’s responsible for the safe handling, transport and storage of information
    
- Data steward: the person or group that maintains and implements data governance policies set by an organization
    

Protecting Data at Every Stage

>> Most security plans include a specific policy that outlines how information will be managed across an organization.

- Known as data governance policy.
    
- As a data custodian, you will be responsible for ensuring that data isn’t damaged, stolen or misused
    

Legally Protected Information

>> Data can represent someone’s personal thoughts, actions and choices. It can represent a purchase, important medical decision, and everything in between.

>> For this reason, data owners should be the ones deciding whether or not to share their data. 

- Securing data can be a challenge, because most data owners generate more data than they can manage themselves.
    
- Governments and regulatory agencies have bridged this gap by creating rules that specify the types of information that organizations must protect by default:
    

Types of Protected Information: 

- PII is any information used to infer an individual’s identity. 
    

- Information that can be used to contact or locate someone.
    

- PHI stands for protected health information. 
    

- HIPAA defines PHI as “information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual”
    

- SPII is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines. The S stands for “sensitive”, meaning this is a type of personally identifiable information that should only be accessed on a need-to-know basis, such as a bank account number or login credentials
    

Information Privacy: Regulations and Compliance

>> How information privacy regulations affect data handling practices. 

>> Some of the most influential security regulations in the world

Information Security vs. Information Privacy

>> Security and privacy are two terms that often get used interchangeably outside of this field. Although the two are connected, they represent specific functions:

- Information Privacy: refers to the protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data
    
- Information Security (InfoSec): refers to the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.
    

Key Difference: privacy is about providing people with control over their own personal information and how it’s shared. Security is about protecting people’s choices and keeping their information safe from potential threats.

Why Privacy Matters in Security:

>> Do organizations have the right to collect and share someone else’s private data?

- Data security became a larger concern, if these companies were storing and sharing massive amounts of it without the consent of the user.
    
- Businesses eventually became more transparent about how they were collecting, storing and using information. 
    

- Also began implementing more security measures to protect people’s data privacy.
    

Notable Privacy Regulations

- Regulations are rules set by a government or another authority to control the way something is done.
    

  
  
  

Three of the most influential industry regulations that every security professionals should know are:

- General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR)
    
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
    
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
    

GDPR

- Rules and regulations adopted by the European Union that puts data owners in control of their personal information.
    

- Includes:
    

- Persons name
    
- Address
    
- Phone number
    
- Financial information
    
- Medical information
    

- This law applies to any organization that handles the data of EU citizens or residents, regardless of where that business operates.
    

PCI DSS

- Set of security standards formed by major organizations in the financial industry. Aims to secure credit and debit transactions against data theft and fraud
    

HIPAA

- U.S. law that requires the protection of sensitive patient information. HIPAA prohibits the disclosure of a person’s medical information without their knowledge or consent.
    

Security Assessments and Audits

- Businesses should comply with important regulations in their industry. 
    
- Doing so validates that they have met a minimum level of security while also demonstrating their dedication to maintaining data privacy.
    

Meeting compliance standards is usually a continual, two-part process of security audits and assessments:

- Security audits are reviews of an organization’s security protocols, policies and procedures against a set of expectations.
    
- Security assessments are checks to determine how resilient current security implementations are against threats
    
- Security audits are typically performed by businesses once per year, and security assessments once per 3-6 month period
    

- Audits are typically 3rd party
    
- Assessments are typically done in house
    

Encryption Methods

>> One of the main controls used to protect information online is cryptography. 

Cryptography

- The process of transforming information into a form that unintended readers can’t understand
    
- Data of any kind is kept secret using a two-step process: encryption to hide the information, and decryption to unhide it.
    

Algorithm

- A set of rules used that solve a problem
    

Cipher

- Algorithm that encrypts information 
    

Cryptographic Key

- A mechanism that decrypts Ciphertext
    

Public Key Infrastructure

- PKI is an encryption framework that secures the exchanges of information online
    
- Broad system that makes accessing information fast, easy and secure
    

Public Key Infrastructure Process

- PKI is a two-step process
    
- Starts with the exchange of encrypted information
    

- Either asymmetric encryption
    
- Symmetric encryption
    
- Or both
    

  
  

Types of Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption

- The use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data
    
- The public key can only be used to add information
    
- The private key allows for the information to be removed
    

- The owner possesses the private key
    

- Slower than Symmetric Encryption
    

Symmetric Encryption

- Faster and simpler approach to key management
    
- Use of a single secret key to exchange information
    
- Instead of a public and private key, Symmetric uses the same key
    

Establishing Trust w/ Digital Certificates

- Digital Certificate: a file that verifies the identity of a public key holder
    

The Importance of Key Length

- Ciphers are vulnerable to brute force attacks, which use a trial and error process to discover private information. 
    

- Digital equivalent of trying every combination on a combination lock until the correct one is input. 
    

- Longer key lengths are more secure, but usually mean longer processing times.
    

Approved Algorithms

- Symmetric Algorithms
    

- Triple DES (3DES) is known as a block cipher because of the way it converts plaintext into ciphertext in “blocks”. 
    

- Origins trace back to the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was developed in the early 1970’s.
    
- Earliest symmetric algorithms that generated 64-bit keys. 
    
- A bit is the smallest unit of data measurement on a computer. 
    
- Triple DES keys are 192 bits (64 * 3)
    

- Advanced Encryption Standard
    

- One of the most secure symmetric algorithms today.
    
- AES generates keys that are 128, 192 or 256 bits.
    
- Cryptographic keys of this size are considered to be safe from brute force attacks. 
    

- Asymmetric Algorithms
    

- Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) is named after it’s three creators after being developed at MIT. 
    

- One of the first encryption algorithms that produces a public and private key pair. 
    
- RSA sizes are 1,024, 2,048 or 4,096 bits.
    
- Mainly used to protect highly sensitive data
    

- Digital Signature Algorithm is a standard asymmetric algorithm that was introduced by NIST in the early 1990’s. DS also generates key lengths of 2,048 bits. 
    

- Widely used today as a compliment to RSA in public key infrastructure.
    

Generating Keys

- OpenSSL: open-source command line tool that can be used to generate public and private keys. 
    

- Commonly used by computers to verify digital certificates that are exchanged as part of public key infrastructure. 
    

Obscurity is not Security

- In the world of security, a cipher must be proven to be unbreakable before claiming that it is secure. 
    
- According to Kerchoff’s Principle, cryptography should be designed in such a way that all the details of an algorithm - except for the private key - should be knowable without sacrificing its security. 
    

Encryption is Everywhere

- Websites tend to use asymmetric encryption to secure small blocks of data that are important. 
    

- Usernames, passwords
    

- Data encryption like this is usually required by law. 
    

- Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-3)
    
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    

  
  
  

Non-repudiation and Hashing

Hash Function: an algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted

- One way process that do not generate decryption keys
    
- Instead, these algorithms produce a unique identifier known as a hash value, or digest.
    

In security, hashes are primarily used as a way to determine the integrity of files and applications.

Data Integrity relates to the accuracy and consistency of information. 

- This is known as non-repudiation
    
- Non-repudiation is the concept that authenticity of information can’t be denied
    

The Evolution of Hash Functions

>> Hash functions are important controls that are part of every company’s security strategy. Hashing is widely used for authentication and non-repudiation

- Hash functions are algorithms that produce a code that can’t be decrypted. Hash functions convert information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. 
    

Origins of Hashing

- Hash functions have been around since the early days of computing
    
- They were originally created as a way to quickly search for data
    
- Designed to represent data of any size as small, fixed-size values, or digests
    
- Using a hash table, which is a data structure that’s used to store and reference hash values, these small values became a more secure and efficient way for computers to reference data. 
    

>> Whether it’s used to convert a single email or the source code of an application, MD5 works by converting data into a 128-bit value. You might recall that a bit is the smallest unit of data measurement on a computer. Bits can either be a 0 or 1. 

- In a computer, bits represent user input in a way that computers can interpret it. In a hash table, this appears as a string of 32 characters.
    
- Altering anything in the source file generates and entirely new hash value.
    

>> Generally, the longer the hash value, the more secure it is. 

Hash Collisions

- One of the flaws in MD5 happens to be a flaw in all hash functions. 
    
- Hash algorithms map any input, regardless of it’s length, into a fixed-size value of letters and numbers. 
    

- There’s only a finite set out available outputs
    

>> MD5 values are limited to 32 bits in length. Due to the limited output size, the algorithm is considered to be vulnerable to hash collisions.

- Hash collisions are instances when different inputs produce the same hash value. 
    
- Because hashes are used for authentication, a hash collision is similar to copying someone’s identity.
    
- Attackers can carry out collision attacks to fraudulently impersonate authentic data.
    

Next Generation Hashing

>> To avoid the risk of hash collisions, functions that generated longer values were needed. 

- New group of functions called Secure Hashing Algorithms, or SHAs.
    

>> The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approves each of these algorithms. Numbers besides each SHA function indicate the size of its hash value in bits. 

- Except for SHA-1, which produces a 160-bit digest, these algorithms are considered to be collision-resistant. 
    
- However, that doesn’t make them invulnerable to other exploits.
    

Five Functions that make up the SHA Family of Algorithms:

1. SHA-1
    
2. SHA-224

Secure Password Storage

- Passwords are typically stored in a database where they are mapped to a username. 
    
- The server receives a request for authentication that contains the credentials supplied by the user.
    
-  It then looks up the surname in the database and compares it with the password that was provided and verifies that it matches before granting access
    

>> This system is safe unless an attacker gains access to the user database. 

- If passwords are stored in plaintext, then an attacker can steal that information and use it to access company resources. 
    
- Hashing adds an additional layer security, because hash values can’t be reversed
    

Rainbow Tables

>> a rainbow table is a file of pre-generated hash values and their associated plaintext.

- Like dictionaries of weak passwords
    
- Rainbow tables can be compared against all possible values in a breached database to gain credentials
    

Adding some “Salt”

- Functions with larger digests are less vulnerable to collision and rainbow table attacks. But, no security protocol is perfect. 
    
- Salting is an additional safeguard that’s used to strengthen hash functions. A salt is a random string of characters that’s added to data before it’s hashed. 
    

- This produces a more unique hash value, making salted data resilient to rainbow table attacks
    

- For example, a database containing passwords might have several hashed entries for the password “password”. 
    

- If those passwords were all salted, each entry would be completely different.
    

- Salting has become increasingly common when storing passwords and other types of sensitive data. 
    

Access Controls and Authorization Systems

Access Controls: Security controls that manage access, authorization and accountability of information

- When done well, access controls maintain confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of data
    
- Also get users the information they need quickly
    

AAA Framework

- Authorization
    
- Authentication
    
- Accounting
    

Authentication Systems

- Serve a very basic purpose: asking anyone attempting to access information: who are you?
    

Factors of Authentication

- Knowledge: something the user knows
    

- Passwords
    
- Security questions
    

- Ownership: referring to something the owner possesses
    

- one-time password, or OTP
    

- Characteristic: something the user is
    

- Biometrics, fingerprints, Face ID, etc.
    

Single Sign-on (SSO)

- Technology that combines several different logins into one
    
- Establishes identity of the user once, allowing them to gain access to their resources faster
    
- Very convenient for users, but very vulnerable if it relies on only a single factor of authentication
    

Multi-factor authentication

- A security measure which require a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network
    

The Rise of SSO and MFA

>> Most companies help keep their data safely locked up behind authentication systems. Usernames and passwords are the keys that unlock information for most organizations.

A Better Approach to Authentication

Single sign-on (SSO) is a technology that combines several different logins into one. Companies are turning to SSO as a solution for three reasons:

1. SSO improves the user experience by eliminating the number of usernames and passwords people have to remember.
    
2. Companies can lower costs by streamlining how they manage connected services
    
3. SSO improves overall security by reducing the number of access points attackers can target
    

>> SSO tech became available in the mid-1990’s to combat password fatigue. 

- Refers to people’s tendency to reuse passwords across services.
    
- Shifts burden of authentication away from the user
    

How SSO works

- SSO works by automating how trust is established between a user and a service provider. Rather than placing the responsibility on an employee or customer, SSO solutions use trusted third-parties to prove that a user is who they claim to be. 
    
- This can be done through the use of encrypted tokens between the identity provider and the service provider
    
- Similar to other kinds of digital information, these access tokens are exchanged using specific protocols.
    

- SSO implementations typically rely on two different auth protocols: LDAP and SAML.
    
- LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is mostly used to transmit information on-premises
    
- SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, mostly used to transmit information of premises, such as in the cloud.
    

Limitations of SSO

- Usernames and passwords alone are not always the most secure way of protecting sensitive information.
    
- SSO provides useful benefits, but there’s still the risk associated with using one form of authentication
    

- A lost or stolen password could expose information across multiple services.
    

MFA to the Rescue

- Multi-factor Authentication requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network
    

- Similar to using an ATM. Insert a debit card, and then a PIN number
    

Strengthening Authentication

- MFA builds on the benefits of SSO. It works by having users prove who they claim to be. 
    
- MFA process asks users to provide these proofs, such as:
    

- Something the user knows: most commonly a username and password
    
- Something a user has: normally received from a service provider, like a one time password sent via SMS
    
- Something a user is: refers to physical characteristics of a user, like their fingerprints or facial scans
    

The Mechanisms of Authorization

Separation of Duties

>> The principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that would allow them to misuse a system

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) uses Basic Auth to establish a user’s request to access a server

- Works by sending an identifier every time a user engages with a web page
    

OAuth

- Open standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between web applications 
    
- Uses API tokens to verify access between you and it’s service provider
    

API Token

- Small block of encrypted code that contains information about a user
    
- Minimize risk in a major way
    
- Keeps your passwords safe on sites that use OAuth even in the event of a breach on another website
    

Why We Audit User Activity

>> Accounting is the practice of monitoring the access logs of a system. These logs contain information like who accessed the system, when they accessed it, and what resources they used

>> Anytime a user accesses a system, they start what is called a session.

- Session: a sequence of network HTTP traffic basic auth requests and responses associated with the same user
    
- Access Logs are essentially records of sessions that capture the moment a user enters a system until the moment they leave it
    

Session ID: a unique token that identifies a user and their device while accessing a system

- Attached to user until they either close their browser or the session times out
    

Session Cookies: a token that websites use to validate a session and determine how long that session should last

- The exchange of tokens means that no sensitive information, like usernames and passwords, are shared.
    
- With a stolen cookie, an attacker can impersonate a user using their session token. 
    

- This kind of attack is known as session hijacking
    

- Event when an attacker obtains a legitimate user’s ID
    

- This is one reason why accounting and monitoring session logs is so important
    

Identity and Access Management

>> A key to ensuring that processes and technologies are creating a secure environment that supports a defense strategy is to implement two fundamental security principles that limit access to organizational resources:

- The principle of least privilege in which a user is only granted the minimum level of access and authorization required to complete a task or functions
    
- Separation of duties which is the principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that would allow them to misuse a system. 
    

Both principles typically support each other. 

- For example, according to least privilege, a person who needs permission to approve purchases from the IT department shouldn’t have the permission to approve purchases from every department. 
    
- Likewise, according to separation of duties, the person who can approve purchases from the IT department should be different from the person who can input new purchases
    

>> Least privilege limits the access that an individual receives, while separation of duties divides responsibilities among multiple people to prevent any one person from having too much control.

Identity and Access Management

>> As organizations become more reliant on technology, regulatory agencies have put more pressure on them to demonstrate that they’re doing everything they can to prevent threats. 

- Identity and access management (IAM) is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. 
    
- Both AAA and IAM systems are designed to authenticate users, determine their access privileges, and track their activities within a system. 
    

>> Either AAA or IAM consist of a collection of security controls that ensure the right user is granted access to the right resources at the right time and for the right reasons. 

- Each of those four factors is determined by your organization’s policies and procedures.
    

Authenticating Users

To ensure the right user is attempting to access a resource requires some form of proof that the user is who they say they claim to be. 

- Knowledge, something the user knows
    
- Ownership, something the user has
    
- Characteristic, something the user is
    

User Provisioning

>> back end systems need to be able to verify whether the information provided by a user is accurate. To accomplish this, users must be appropriately provisioned.

- User provisioning is the process of creating and maintaining a user’s digital identity. 
    
- Another role that security analysts have is to deprovision users, which is an important piece that removes a user’s access rights when they should no longer have them.
    

Granting Authorization

>> If the right user has been authenticated, the network should ensure the right resources are made available. There are three common frameworks that organizations use to handle this step of IAM:

- Mandatory access control (MAC)
    
- Discretionary access control (DAC)
    
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
    

Mandatory Access Control

- Strictest of the three frameworks.
    
- Authorization in this model is based on a need-to-know basis
    
- MAC is commonly applied in law enforcement, military and government agencies where users must request access through a chain of command. 
    

- MAC is known as a non-discretionary control because access isn’t given at the discretion of the data owner. 
    

Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

- DAC is typically applied when a data owner decides appropriate levels of access. One example of DAC is when the owner of a Google Drive folder shares editor, viewer or commentator access with someone else.
    

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- RBAC is used when authorization is determined by a user’s role within an organization. For example, a user in the marketing department may have access to user analytics but not network administration.
    

Access Control Technologies

- A typical IAM or AAA system consists of a user directory, a set of tools for managing data in that directory, an authorization system, and an auditing system. 
    
- Some organizations create custom systems that are tailored to their specific needs.
    

- Comes with a steep cost of resources and time. 
    

Module 3: Flaws in the System

>> What we’ll learn:

- Vulnerability management process
    
- Defense in depth model
    
- The CVE list
    
- Attack surfaces
    
- Common attack vectors
    

Vulnerability Management

>> Finding vulnerabilities and fixing them before they become a problem is the key to keep an asset safe.

- A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. 
    

>> Security analysts plan to protect assets according to their vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. 

- An exploit is a way of taking advantage of a vulnerability
    

>> Vulnerability management is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilities

Vulnerability Management is a four-step process

1. Identify vulnerabilities
    
2. Consider potential exploits
    
3. Prepare defenses against threats
    
4. Evaluate those defenses
    

Zero-Days are exploits that were previously unknown

- Things that don’t normally come to mind when developing defenses
    
- New forms of spyware, etc.
    

Defense in Depth Strategy

>> A layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk

- Castle Approach
    

Defense in Depth Strategy

1. Perimeter Layer: includes things like usernames and passwords. Mainly the user authentication layer that filters external access.
    

1. Allow only trusted partners to reach the next layer of defense
    

3. Network Layer: Authorization. Network firewalls, etc.
    
4. Endpoint Layer: Devices that have access to a network, like laptops, servers, desktops. Anti-virus software.
    
5. Application Layer: All interfaces used to interact with technology. MFA is commonly used here.
    
6. Data Layer: critical data that must be protected. Access classification is used here. 
    

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

>> While a vulnerability is a weakness of a system, an exposure is a mistake that can be exploited by a threat.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures List (CVE List):

- An openly accessible dictionary of known vulnerabilities and exposures
    
- Originally created by MITRE
    

- MITRE is a collection of non-profit research and development centers, sponsored by the government
    

- Focus is on improving security technologies around the world
    

>> Most vulnerabilities in the CVE list are reported by independent researchers, technology vendors and ethical hackers

>> Before a vulnerability is added to the CVE list, it goes through a verification process by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)

- CNA are organizations that volunteer to analyze and distribute information on eligible CVEs
    

CVE List Criteria:

1. Independent of other issues
    
2. Recognized as a potential security risk
    
3. Submitted with supporting evidence
    
4. Can only affect one codebase
    

>> NIST National Vulnerabilities Database

- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): a measurement system that scores the severity of a vulnerability
    
- Way of calculating the impact a vulnerability can have on a system on a score of 0-10.
    
- Anything below of 4 on the scale is considered low risk, but anything above a 9 is considered critical and is recommended to be patched immediately
    

>> Security teams commonly use the CVE list and CVSS scores as part of their vulnerability management strategy.

- These references provide recommendations for prioritizing security fixes, like installing software updates before patches.
    

The OWASP Top 10

>> Learn the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)’s role in the global security community and how companies use this resource to focus their efforts.

What is OWASP?

- Nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. OWASP is an open platform that security professionals from around the world use to share information, tools and events that are focused on securing the web.
    

The OWASP Top 10

- One of OWASP’s top resources is their top 10 list of the web’s most targeted web vulnerabilities.
    

- Auditors now use the OWASP Top 10 as one point of reference when checking for regulatory compliance.
    

Common Vulnerabilities

>> Businesses often make critical security decisions based on the vulnerabilities of the OWASP Top 10. 

- Influences how businesses design new software that will be on their network, unlike the CVE list, which helps them identify improvements to existing programs.
    

>> These are the most commonly listed vulnerabilities that appear in their rankings to know about:

1. Broken Access Control
    

1. Access controls limit what users can do in a web application. Failures in these systems can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information, modification or destruction. 
    

3. Cryptographic Failures
    

1. Information is one of the most important assets a business can have. 
    
2. GDPR requires that sensitive information must be protected by effective encryption methods. 
    

1. If a web application uses weak encryption methods and hashing algorithms, they are more vulnerable to breaches.
    

5. Injection
    

1. Injection occurs when malicious code is inserted into a vulnerable application
    
2. Although the app appears to work normally, it does things it wasn’t intended to do. 
    
3. Injection attacks can give attackers a backdoor into an organization’s information system.
    

1. Common target is a website’s login from, where successful injections can steal user credentials or modify them
    

7. Insecure Design
    

1. Insecure design refers to a wide range of missing or poorly implemented security controls that should have been programmed into an application when it was being developed. 
    

9. Security Misconfiguration
    

1. When security settings are properly set or maintained. 
    
2. Mistakes often happen when interconnected systems aren’t properly set up or audited. 
    
3. Commonly happens when businesses deploy equipment, like network servers, with default settings and configurations
    

11. Vulnerable and outdated Components
    

1. Area that mainly relates to application development. Instead of coding everything from scratch, developers often use open-source libraries to complete their projects faster and easier. 
    
2. Sometimes, these external components are vulnerable, and thus, so is the application 
    

13. Identification and Authentication Failures
    

1. When applications fail to recognize who should have access and what they’re authorized to do, it can cause serious issues.
    

15. Software and Data Integrity Failures
    

1. Instances when updates or patches are inadequately reviewed before implementation. Attackers might exploit these weaknesses to deliver malicious software.
    
2. Third parties are likely to become infected if a single system is compromised, an event known as a supply chain attack
    

17. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
    

1. Having a record of events like user login attempts is critical to finding and fixing problems. Sufficient monitoring and incident response are equally as imporant. 
    

19. Server-side Request Forgery
    

1. Companies have public and private information stored on web servers. When you use a hyperlink or click a button on a website, a request is sent to a server to validate who you are, fetch the appropriate data, and then return it to you.
    
2. SSRFS are when attackers manipulate the normal operations of a server to read update other resources on that server.
    
3. Malicious code can be carried by the vulnerable app to the host server that will fetch unauthorized data.
    

Open Source Intelligence

>> Cyber attacks can sometimes be prevented with the right information, which starts with knowing where your systems are vulnerable.

>> In this reading, we will learn about open-source intelligence, commonly known as OSINT.

- OSINT is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence.
    
- Commonly used to support cybersecurity activities, like identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    
- Why OSINT is gathered and how it can be used to improve cybersecurity
    

Information vs. Intelligence

>> Information refers to the collection of raw data or facts about an update to the operating system that’s installed on your organization’s workstations.

>> Intelligence refers to the analysis of information to produce knowledge or insights that can be used to support decision making.

- New information may be released about the OS your organization uses
    
- Later, you may find that new cyber threats are linked to this update by researching multiple cybersecurity news resources.
    
- Intelligence is derived from information through the process of analysis
    

Intelligence Improves Decision-Making

>> Businesses often use information to gain insights into the behavior of their customers. 

>> Insights, or intelligence, can then be used to improve their decision-making.

- OSINT plays a significant role in information security (InfoSec), which is the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.
    
- InfoSec team is responsible for protecting their network from potential threats, and they might use OSINT to monitor online forums and hacker communities for discussions about emerging vulnerabilities.
    

>> Some ways that OSINT can be used to generate intelligence:

- Provide insights into cyber attacks
    
- Detect potential data exposures
    
- Evaluate existing defenses
    
- Identify unknown vulnerabilities
    

Collecting intelligence is sometimes part of the vulnerability management process.

OSINT Tools

>> Information can be gathered from a variety of sources, such as search engines, social media, discussion boards, blogs and more.

Vulnerability Assessments

>> Internal review process of an organization’s security systems

- Goal is to identify weak points and prevent attacks
    
- Determine whether security controls meet compliance and regulations
    

Vulnerability Assessment Process

1. Identification
    
2. Vulnerability analysis
    
3. Risk assessment
    
4. Remediation
    

Approaches to Vulnerability Scanning

>> Vulnerability Assessments are internal reviews of the processes of an organization’s security systems.

- Used to identify weaknesses and prevent attacks
    
- Vulnerability scanning tools are commonly used to simulate threats by finding vulnerabilities in an attack surface
    
- Help security teams take proactive steps towards implementing remediation strategy
    

What is a Vulnerability Scanner?

>> A vulnerability scanner is software that automatically compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network

- In general, these tools scan systems to find misconfigurations or programming flaws
    

>> Scanning tools are used to analyze each of the five attack surfaces that you learned about in Defense in Depth module.

Defense in Depth Model:

1. Perimeter layer: authentication systems that validate user access
    
2. Network layer: made up of technologies like network firewalls and others
    
3. Endpoint layer: describes devices on a network, like laptops, desktops or servers
    
4. Application layer: involves the software that users interact with
    
5. Data layer: includes any information that’s stored, in transit or in use
    

Performing Scans

>> Vulnerability scanners are meant to be non-intrusive. Meaning, they don’t break or take advantage of a system like an attacker would. Instead, they simply scan a surface and alert you to any potentially unlocked doors in your systems

External vs. Internal

>> External and internal scans simulate an attackers approach.

External Scans test the perimeter layer outside of the internal network. They analyze outward facing systems, like websites and firewalls.

- These kinds of scans can uncover vulnerable things like vulnerable network ports or servers.
    

Internal Scans start from the opposite end by examining an organization’s internal systems. For example, this type of scan might analyze application software for weaknesses in how it handles user input.

Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated

>> Authenticated and unauthenticated scans simulate whether or not a user has access to a system.

- Authenticated scans might test a system by loggin in with a real user account or even with an admin account. 
    

- These service accounts are used to check for vulnerabilities, like broken access controls.
    

- Unauthenticated scans simulate external threat actors that do not have access to your business resources. 
    

- For example, a scan might analyze file shares within the organization that are used to house internal-only documents. 
    
- Unauthenticated users should receive “access denied” results if they try to open these files. 
    

- A vulnerability would be the ability to access secure files.
    

Limited vs. Comprehensive

>> Limited and comprehensive scans focus on particular devices that are accessed by internal and external users. 

- Limited Scans analyze particular devices on a network, like searching for misconfigurations on a firewall.
    
- Comprehensive scans analyze all devices connected to a network. This includes OS, user databases, and more.
    
- Discovery scanning should be done prior to limited or comprehensive scans. Discovery scanning is used to get an idea of the computers, devices and open ports that are on a network
    

The Importance of Updates

>> “Why do my devices need constant updating?” 

- Updates provide improvements to performance, stability and even new features. 
    
- From a security standpoint, they serve a specific purpose. Updates allow organizations to address security vulnerabilities that can place their users, devices and networks at risk
    

Patching Gaps in Security 

- A patch update is a software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches usually contain bug fixes that address common security vulnerabilities and exposures.
    

  

Common Update Strategies

>> When software updates become available, clients and users have two installation options:

- Manual updates
    
- Automatic updates
    

Manual Updates

- A manual deployment strategy relies on IT infrastructure or users obtaining updates from the developers. 
    
- In enterprise environments, the process is usually handled with a configuration management tool. 
    

- These tools usually offer a range of options to deploy updates, like to all clients on your network or a select group of users.
    

- Advantage: control. This can be useful if software updates are not thoroughly tested by developers, leading to instability.
    
- Disadvantage: critical updates can be forgotten or disregarded entirely.
    

Automatic Updates

>> Automatic update strategy takes the opposite approach to manual. 

- Finding, downloading and installing updates can be done by the system or application.
    

>>  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends using automatic options whenever available. 

- Certain permissions need to be enabled by users or IT groups before updates can be installed, or pushed, when they’re available.  It is up to the developers to adequately test their patches before release. 
    
- Advantage: deployment process is simplified. Also keeps systems and software current with the latest, critical patches
    
- Disadvantage: instability issues can occur if the patches were not thoroughly tested by the vendor, resulting in performance problems and a poor user experience.
    

End-of-Life Software

- Sometimes updates are not available for a certain type of software known as an end of life (EOL) software. A
    

- All software has a lifecycle
    

- Begins when it is produced and ends when a newer version is released
    

- WHile the older software is still useful, the developer no longer supports it
    

- CISA recommends discontinuing the use of EOL software because it poses an unfixable risk to systems.
    

- This is not always followed, as replacing an EOL system is sometimes too costly or critical to operations
    

Penetration Testing

>> How security teams evaluate the effectiveness of their defenses using penetration testing.

- A penetration test, or pen test, is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, applications and processes. 
    
- Involves using the same tools and techniques as malicious actors in order to mimic a real life attack
    
- Since a pen test is an authorized attack, it is considered to be a form of ethical hacking. 
    

Learn from Varied Perspectives

- These authorized attacks are performed by pen testers who are skilled in programming and network architecture. Depending on their objectives, organizations might use a few different approaches to penetration testing.
    

- Red team tests simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks or applications.
    
- Blue team tests focus on defense and incident response to validate an organization’s existing security systems
    
- Purple team tests are collaborative , focusing on improving the security posture of the organization by combining elements of red and blue team exercises. 
    

- Red team tests are commonly performed by independent pen testers who are hired to evaluate internal systems.
    

>> How much access and information do I need? 

Penetration Testing Strategies

>> There are three common penetration testing strategies:

- Open-box testing is when the tester has the same privileged access that an internal developer would have, information like system architecture, data flow, and network diagrams. 
    

- Goes by several different names, like internal, full knowledge, white-box, and clear box penetration testing
    

- Closed-box testing is when the tester has little to no access to internal systems, similar to a malicious hacker. 
    

- Referred to as external, black-box, or zero knowledge penetration testing
    

- Partial-knowledge testing is when the tester has limited access and knowledge of an internal system– for example, a customer service representative. 
    

- Known as grey-box testing
    

>> Closed box testers provide the most accurate simulations of a real-world attack. Nevertheless, each strategy produces valuable results by demonstrating how an attacker might infiltrate a system and what information they could access.

Becoming a Penetration Tester

>> Penetration testers are in demand in the growing field of cybersecurity. All of the skills learned in this course will help advance you towards a career in pen testing.

- Network and application security
    
- Experience with OS, like Linux
    
- Vulnerability analysis and threat modeling
    
- Detection and response tools
    
- Programming languages like Python and Bash
    
- Communication skills
    

Bug Bounty Programs

>> organizations commonly run bug bounty programs which offer freelance pen testers financial rewards for finding and reporting vulnerabilities in their products. 

- Bug bounties are great opportunities for amatuer security professionals to participate and grow their skills. 
    

Protect all Entry Points

>> To position themselves ahead of threats and make the most of their limited resources, companies start by understanding the environment surrounding their operations. An important part of this is getting a sense of their attack surface.

An attack surface is all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

- Analyzing the attack surface is usually the first thing security teams do
    

>> Modern enterprises need to prepare themselves for both a physical and digital attack surface

Security Hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce it’s vulnerabilities and attack surface.

Digital Attack Surface included everything that is beyond our organization’s firewall.

- Anything that connects to an organization online
    

Approaching Cybersecurity with an Attacker’s Mindset

>> As a security professional, it is up to you to be prepared by anticipating change.

>> Learn how to use the findings of a vulnerability assessment proactively by analyzing them from an attacker’s perspective.

Be Prepared for Anything

>> Having a plan should things go wrong is important. But how do you figure out what to plan for?

- In security, that often means conducting simulations of things that can go wrong as part of their vulnerability management strategy
    

>> An attackers mindset is a lot like conducting an experiment. It’s about causing problems in a controlled environment and evaluating the outcome to gain insights. 

- The insights gained can be valuable when it’s time to establish a security plan or modify an existing one.
    

Simulating Threats

>> Attack simulations are normally performed in one of two ways: proactively or reactively.

- Proactive Simulations assume the role of an attacker by exploiting vulnerabilities and breaking through defenses. Red team exercise. 
    
- Reactive Simulations assume the role of a defender responding to an attack. Blue team exercise.
    

Scanning for Trouble

>> Vulnerability scanner is software that automatically compares existing common vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network. 

>> For example, a team conducting a reactive simulation might perform an external vulnerability scan of their network. The entire exercise might follow the steps you learned in a video about vulnerability assessments.

- Identification: a vulnerable server is flagged because it’s running an outdated OS.
    
- Vulnerability analysis: Research done on the outdated OS and its vulnerabilities.
    
- Risk Assessment: After doing your due diligence, the severity of each vulnerability is scored and the impact of not fixing it is evaluated.
    
- Remediation: Finally, the information that you’ve gathered can be used to address the issue. 
    

>> Clearly communicating the results of these exercises to others is an important skill to develop as a security professional. 

Finding Innovative Solutions

>> Many security controls that you’ve learned about were created as a reactive response to risks. 

- Criminals are continually looking for ways to bypass existing defenses. 
    

Types of Threat Actors

>> More about threat actors and the types of risks they pose. Explore the most common features of an attack surface threat actors can exploit.

Threat Actors

>> A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. 

- Refers to people inside and outside the organization.
    
- People who intentionally pose a threat, and those that accidentally put assets at risk.
    

>> Threat actors are normally divided into five groups based on their motivations:

- Competitors refers to rival companies who pose a threat because they might find benefit from leaked information.
    
- State actors are government intelligence agencies
    
- Criminal syndicates refer to organized groups of people who make money from criminal activity
    
- Insider threats can be any individual who has or had authorized access to an organization’s resources. This includes employees who accidentally compromise assets or individuals who purposefully put them at risk for their own benefit.
    
- Shadow IT refers to individuals who use technologies that lack IT governance. A common example is when an employee used their personal email to send work related communications.
    

>> By definition, a hacker is any person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or data. 

Types of Hackers

>> Because of the broad definition of hacker, the term can be a bit ambiguous. In security, it applies to three types of individuals based on their intent:

1. Unauthorized hackers
    
2. Authorized, or ethical hackers
    
3. Semi-authorized hackers
    

>> An unauthorized hacker is an individual who uses their programming skills to commit crimes. Also known as malicious hackers. 

- There are hackers with limited skills who can’t write their own malicious software, sometimes called script kiddies.
    

- These hackers carry out attacks with pre-written code that they obtain from other, more skilled hackers.
    

>> Authorized, or ethical hackers, refer to individuals who use their programming skills to improve an organization's overall security. 

- Includes members of security teams, and external vendors or freelance hackers that some companies incentivize to find and report vulnerabilities through bug bounties.
    

>> Semi-authorized hackers typically refer to individuals who might violate ethical standards, but are not considered malicious. 

- A hacktivist is a person who might use their skills to achieve a political goal.
    
- The intentions of these types of threat actors is often to expose security risks that should be addressed before a malicious hacker finds them.
    

Advanced Persistent Threats

>> On some occasions, threat actors stick around after an attack. These are known as advanced persistent threats, or APTs. 

- APTs refers instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. 
    
- Usually associated with nation-states and state-sponsored attackers. 
    
- Typically concerned with surveillance and intelligence gathering as the goal of attacks.
    
- APTs will often target private organizations first as a step towards gaining access to larger entities (supply chain attack) 
    

Access Points

>> Keeping attackers out takes more than knowing their intentions and capabilities. It’s also important to know the types of attack vectors they will use. 

- Direct access: referring to instances when they have physical access to a system
    
- Removable media: which includes portable hardware, like USB flash drives
    
- Social media platforms that are used for communication and content sharing
    
- Email, including both personal and business accounts
    
- Wireless networks on premises
    
- Cloud services usually provided by third party organizations
    
- Supply chains like third party vendors that can present a backdoor into systems
    

Pathways Through Defenses

>> To defend against attacks, organizations need to have more than just the understanding of the growing digital landscape around them. 

Attack Vectors are the pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses

Practicing an Attacker Mindset

1. Identify a target
    
2. Determine how the target can be accessed
    
3. Evaluate the attack vectors that can be exploited
    
4. Tools and methods of attack
    

Defending Digital Attack Vectors

1. Educating users
    
2. Principle of least privilege
    
3. Using the right security controls and tools
    
4. Building a diverse security team
    

  
  

Fortify Against Brute Force Cyberattacks

>> Passwords and user credentials are one of the most common and important security controls in use today, but they are vulnerable to being stolen or guessed by attackers.

>> Learn the tools and tactics used by threat actors to perform brute force attacks, and prevention strategies to defend against them.

A Matter of Trial and Error

>> Attackers use a variety of tactics to find their way into a system:

- Simple Brute Force attacks are an approach in which attackers guess a user’s login credentials. 
    
- Dictionary Attacks are a similar technique except in these instances attackers use a list of commonly used credentials to access a system. 
    
- Reverse Brute Force attacks are similar to dictionary attacks, except they start with a single credential and try it in various systems until a match is found.
    
- Credential Stuffing is a tactic in which attackers use stolen login credentials from previous data breaches to access user accounts at another organization.
    

- A specialized version of credential stuffing is called pass the hash, where attackers reuse stolen, unsalted hashed credentials to trick an authentication system into creating a new authenticated user session on the network. 
    

Tools of the Trade

>> Instead of dedicating the time to brute force manually, attackers often use software to do the guesswork for them. 

These are some common brute forcing tools:

- Aircrack-ng
    
- Hashcat
    
- John the Ripper
    
- Ophcrack
    
- THC Hydra
    

>> These tools are sometimes used by security professionals to test and analyze their own systems. 

Prevention Measures

>> Organizations defend against brute force attacks using a combination of technical and managerial controls.

- Hashing and Salting
    
- Multi-factor authentication
    
- CAPTCHA
    
- Password policies
    

Hashing and Salting

>> Hashing converts information into a unique value that can the be used to determine its integrity.

>> Salting is an additional safeguard that’s used to strengthen hash functions. 

- Works by adding random characters to data, like passwords. 
    

Multi-Factor Authentication

>> Multi-factor authentication is a security measure that requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. 

- MFA is a layered approach to protecting information
    
- MFA limits the chances of brute force attacks because unauthorized users are unlikely to meet each authentication requirement even if one or more credential has been compromised
    

CAPTCHA 

>> Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart

- Known as a challenge-response system. 
    
- Asks users to complete a simple test that proves they are human and not software that’s trying to brute force a password. 
    

Password Policy

>> Managerial controls to standardize good password practices across their businesses. 

- Password length requirements
    
- Special character requirements
    
- Password lockout policies after multiple failed attempts
    

  

Module 4: Threats

>> Threat: any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

- Social Engineering
    
- Malware
    
- Web-based exploits
    
- Threat Modeling Process
    

Social Engineering

>> Malicious hackers require technical programming skills to complete their objectives, but not all “hackers” use technical skills to achieve their objectives.

Social Engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access or valuables.

- Social engineering attacks can happen anywhere. Online, in person or even at home.
    

Stages of Social Engineering

- Prepare - gathering information
    
- Establish trust - pretexting
    
- Persuasion tactics
    
- Disconnect from the target
    

Preventing Social Engineering

- Implementing managerial controls
    
- Staying informed of trends
    
- Sharing your knowledge with others
    

Social Engineering Tactics

>> It’s often easier to trick people than it is to trick machines.

Social Engineering Risks

>> Social engineering is a form of deception that takes advantage of the way people think. It preys on people’s natural feelings of curiosity, generosity and excitement. 

- Social engineering presents a significant risk because they don’t require sophisticated computer skills to perform. 
    

Signs of an Attack

>> People are often unaware of an attack taking place until it is too late. 

- Social engineering typically allows attackers to bypass technological defenses that are in the way. 
    
- Recognizing the signs of social engineering is a key to reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.
    

>> These are the common types of social engineering to look out for:

- Baiting is a social engineering tactic that tempts people into compromising their security. A common example is USB baiting that relies on someone finding an infected USB drive and plugging it into their device.
    
- Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing their sensitive data or deploying malicious software. Typically performed via email.
    
- Quid Pro Quo is a type of baiting used to trick someone into believing that they’ll be rewarded for sharing access, information or money. 
    

- Attacker impersonating a loan officer at a bank offering customers a lower interest rate on their credit card. 
    

- Tailgating is a social engineering tactic in which unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. 
    
- Watering hole is a type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. Oftentimes, these watering hole sites are infected with malicious code
    

Encouraging Caution

>> Spreading awareness usually starts with comprehensive security training. When it comes to social engineering, there are three main areas to focus on when teaching others:

- Stay alert of suspicious communications and unknown people, especially when it comes to email. 
    
- Be cautious about sharing information, especially over social media. Threat actors often use these platforms to gain access to information they can use to their advantage.
    
- Control curiosity when something seems too good to be true. This can include wanting to click on attachments or links in emails and advertisements
    

>> Implementing technologies like firewalls, MFA, block lists, email filtering can add controls for when people inevitably make a mistake.

Phishing for Information

>> Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

- Usually used to describe attacks that arrive by email
    

>> a Phishing kit is a collection of software tools needed to launch a phishing campaign

- Phishing kit tools:
    

- Malicious attachment
    
- Fake data-collection forms
    
- Fraudulent web links
    

>> Smishing is the use of text messages to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

>> Vishing is the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source

Phishing Security Measures

- Anti-phishing policies
    
- Employee training resources
    
- Securing email inboxes with filters
    

- Block lists
    

- Intrusion prevention systems
    

Types of Phishing

>> Common phishing tactics used by attackers today.

Origins of Phishing

>> has been around since 1990’s, in the early days of the internet

- Criminals learned that the internet gave them a high degree of anonymity to commit their crimes
    

Early Persuasion Tactics

>> AOL Instant Messenger was one of the first targets of a mass phishing attack.

- Attackers made realistic looking emails requesting account verification or personal billing information.
    

How Phishing Has Evolved

>> The introduction of online marketplaces presented new opportunities for attackers to commit crimes. 

>> There are five common phishing attacks that every security analyst should know:

- Email phishing is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity
    
- Smishing is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS), the technology that powers text messaging. 
    

- Covers all forms of text messaging services, like Apple’s iMessage, WhatsApp, and other chat mediums
    

- Vishing refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information.
    
- Spear phishing is a subset of email phishing that targets specific people with access to privileged information
    
- Whaling refers to a category of spear phishing that attempts to target high-ranking executives in an organization
    

Recent Trends

>> Mass phishing became less common, in favor of targeted phishing attacks with highly specified and customized methods to create a strong sense of familiarity.

Angler Phishing is a technique where attackers impersonate customer service representatives on social media. 

- Emerged from people’s tendencies to complain about businesses online. 
    
- Find complaints online, then impersonate a customer service agent and trick the angry customer into revealing sensitive information with a promise of fixing the problem.
    

Malware

>> Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks

- Malware takes control of an infected machine without the users knowledge or permission
    
- Has been a threat since the dawn of computing and the internet
    

  

Most Common Types of Malware:

1. Virus
    
2. Worm
    
3. Trojan
    
4. Ransomware
    
5. Spyware
    

>> a Virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software

- Typically hide inside of trusted applications
    
- They have to be activated by the user to start infection
    
- Commonly spread through phishing links or attachments
    

>> A Worm is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own.

- Use infected device as a host, then spread to the network without requiring an action by the user
    

>> A Trojan is malware that looks like a legitimate file or program

- Typically disguised as files or useful applications to trick users into installing them
    
- Used to gain access and install other malware
    

>> Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access

- Have become very common
    
- Make themselves known to their targets
    
- WannaCry
    

>> Spyware is malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent

- Consent is the keyword in this case
    
- Customers must opt into sharing data by legitimate sources
    
- Also considered a PUA
    
- PUAs like spyware have become a serious challenge in the open-source community, because developers tend to overlook how their software could be misused by others.
    

An Introduction to Malware

>> Adware is a type of legitimate software that is sometimes used to display digital advertisements in applications. 

- Used by developers to lower their production costs or to make products free to the public – known as freeware or shareware
    
- Malicious adware falls into a sub-category known as potentially unwanted application (PUA).
    

- PUA is a type of unwanted software that is bundled in with legitimate programs which might display ads, cause device slowdown, or install other software.
    

>> Scareware is another type of PUA, which employs fright tactics to frighten users into infecting their own system. 

- Scareware typically displays fake warnings that appear to come from legitimate companies. 
    
- Used to deliver phony messages with false claims about the user’s files being at risk.
    

>> Fileless Malware does not need to be installed by the user because it use legitimate programs that are already installed to infect a computer.

- This type of infection resides in memory where the malware never touches the hard drive. 
    
- Stealthy infections that get into the operating system or hide within trusted applications
    

>> Rootkits is malware that provides remote, administrative access to a computer.

- Most rootkits are used to install a backdoor into a system, allowing other forms of malware to be installed later or to conduct network security attacks.
    
- Typically spread with two components: a dropper and a loader.
    

- A dropper is a type of malware that comes packed with malicious code which is delivered and installed to a target system.
    

- Typically disguised as a legitimate application, file, image or document
    
- Once opened, the dropper executes its code and hides itself.
    

- A loader is a type of malware that downloads strains of malicious code from an external source and installs them onto a target system.
    

- Attackers might use loaders for different purposes, such as to set up another type of malware - a botnet.
    

>> Botnets are short for “robot network”. They are collections of computers infected with malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the bot-herder. 

- The attacker then uses file sharing, email or social media applications to create new bots and grow the botnet. 
    
- When the target opens the malicious file, the bot reports back to the herder, who then can execute commands on the infected computer.
    

The Rise of Cryptojacking

>> As a security professional, it's important to remain aware of certain evolutions of malware. 

Cryptojacking is a form of malware that installs software to illegally mine cryptocurrencies

- Cryptomining is a process used to create new coins or tokens
    

>> Criminals now regularly target vulnerable servers to install their crypto mining software.

- Servers are targeted due to them having a large amount of processing power available
    
- Cryptojacking malware can be hard to detect
    

Intrusion Detection Systems are applications that monitor system activity and alerts on possible intrusions

Signs of Cryptojacking

- System slowdown
    
- Increased CPU usage
    
- Sudden system crashes
    
- Fast draining batteries
    
- Unusually high electricity costs
    

Web-Based Exploits

>> malicious code or behavior that’s used to take advantage of coding flaws in a web application

- Web applications are valuable targets because they interact with multiple users across multiple networks
    

>> Injection Attacks are malicious code inserted into a vulnerable application

- The infected application usually appears to work normally
    
- Web apps are vulnerable to these attacks because they are programmed to receive data inputs
    

>> Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an injection attack that inserts code into a vulnerable website or web application

- Often delivered by exploiting HTML and JavaScript
    
- Can give attackers access to everything that loads on an infected webpage
    

- Session cookies, webcams, microphones
    

>> Types of cross-site scripting attacks

1. Reflected
    
2. Stored
    
3. DOM-based
    

>> Reflected XSS attack is an instance when a malicious script is sent to a server and activated during the server’s response.

- Tricks the server into sending the malicious script back to the user, who receives it since the server believes the user is a trusted source
    

>> Stored XSS attack is an instance when malicious script is injected directly on the server

- Attackers target elements of a site that are served to the user
    

- Things like buttons, images, that load when the site is visited.
    
- Infected elements activate the malicious code when a user simply visits the site.
    
- Stored XSS attacks can be damaging because the user has no way of knowing the site is infected beforehand
    

>> DOM-based attacks 

- DOM stands for Document Object Model
    

- Basically the source code of a website
    

- Instance when malicious script exists in the webpage a browser loads
    
- In DOM-based attacks, the website’s URL displays the script being used
    

- When the user makes a selection, it appears as part of the URL
    

- Criminals change the parameter that’s expecting an input.
    

- For example, they could hide malicious JavaScript in the HTML tags. 
    
- The browser would process the HTML and execute the JavaScript
    

  
  

Exploitable Gaps in Databases

>> SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database

- Used by most applications, particularly shopping applications
    

>> SQL Injection is an attack the executes unexpected queries on a database

- Occurs due to the lack of sanitized input
    
- Common example is the login form to access a site
    
- Commonly happens because web developers expect people to use these inputs correctly, and not exploit them
    

- ![unchecked](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEgAAABICAYAAABV7bNHAAAA1ElEQVR4Ae3bMQ4BURSFYY2xBuwQ7BIkTGxFRj9Oo9RdkXn5TvL3L19u+2ZmZmZmZhVbpH26pFcaJ9IrndMudb/CWadHGiden1bll9MIzqd79SUd0thY20qga4NA50qgoUGgoRJo/NL/V/N+QIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIEyFeEZyXQpUGgUyXQrkGgTSVQl/qGcG5pnkq3Sn0jOMv0k3Vpm05pmNjfsGPalFyOmZmZmdkbSS9cKbtzhxMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)
    
    For example, a hacker might insert additional SQL code, that would cause the server to run a harmful query of code that it wasn’t expecting.
    

- ![unchecked](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEgAAABICAYAAABV7bNHAAAA1ElEQVR4Ae3bMQ4BURSFYY2xBuwQ7BIkTGxFRj9Oo9RdkXn5TvL3L19u+2ZmZmZmZhVbpH26pFcaJ9IrndMudb/CWadHGiden1bll9MIzqd79SUd0thY20qga4NA50qgoUGgoRJo/NL/V/N+QIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIECBAgQIAAAQIEyFeEZyXQpUGgUyXQrkGgTSVQl/qGcG5pnkq3Sn0jOMv0k3Vpm05pmNjfsGPalFyOmZmZmdkbSS9cKbtzhxMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)
    
    Malicious hackers can then target these vectors to obtain sensitive information, modify tables and even gain admin rights to the database.
    

  

>> The best way to defend against SQL injection is code that will sanitize the input

- Devs can write code to search for specific SQL characters. 
    
- This gives the server a clearer idea of what inputs to expect
    

>> A prepared statement is a coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on to the database.

- A prepared statement executes the code before passing it on to the server. 
    
- This means the code can be validated before permitting the query
    

Prevent Injection Attacks

>> Malicious SQL Injection is a type of attack that executes unexpected queries on a database. 

- Threat actors perform SQL injections to modify, delete or steal information from a database.
    

>> SQL Injections are commonly listed on the OWASP top 10 because developers tend to focus on making their applications work correctly rather than protecting their products from injection. 

SQL Queries

>>  Every bit of information that’s accessed online is stored in a database. A database is an organized collection of information or data in one place. 

- A database can include data such as an organization’s employee directory or customer payment methods. In SQL, database information is organized in tables. 
    
- SQL is commonly used for retrieving, inserting, updating or deleting information from tables using queries. 
    

>> An SQL Query is a request for data from a database. For example, a SQL query can request data from an organization’s employee directory such as employee IDs, names and job titles. 

- SQL injections can occur anywhere within a vulnerable application that can accept an SQL query.
    

>> Queries are typically used in areas where users can input information into an application or a website via an input field. 

- Input fields are search bars, login forms or comment submission boxes.
    
- SQL injections exploit input fields that aren’t programmed to filter out unwanted text. 
    
- SQL injections can be used to manipulate databases, steal sensitive data, or even take control of applications. 
    

SQL Injection Categories

>> Three main types of SQL injection:

- In-band
    
- Out-of-band
    
- Inferential
    

In-Band SQL Injection

>> In band, or classic, SQL injection is the most common type. An in band injection is one that uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results.

- For example, this might occur in the search box of a retailer’s website that lets customers find products to buy. If the search box is vulnerable to injection, an attacker could enter a malicious query that would be executed in the database, causing it to return sensitive information like user passwords. 
    
- The data that’s returned is displayed back in search box where the attack was inititated
    

Out of Band SQL Injection

>> An out-of-band injection is one that uses a different communication channel to launch the attack and gather the results.

- For example, an attacker could use a malicious query to create a connection between a vulnerable website and a database they control. This separate channel would allow them to bypass any security controls that are in place on the website’s server allowing them to steal sensitive data. 
    
- Note: out-of-band injections attacks are very uncommon because they’ll only work when certain features are enabled on the target server
    

Inferential SQL Injection

>> Inferential SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is unable to directly see the results of their attack. Instead, they can interpret the results by analyzing the behavior in a system. 

- For example, an attacker might perform an SQL injection attack on the login form of a website that causes the system to respond with an error message. Although sensitive data is not returned, the attacker can figure out the database’s structure based on the error. They can then use this information to craft attacks that will give them access to sensitive data or to take control of the system.
    

Injection Prevention

>> SQL queries are often programmed with the assumption that users will only input relevant information. For example, a login form that expects users to input their email address assumes the input will be formatted a certain way, such as jdoe@domain.com 

>> a key to preventing SQL injection attacks is to escape user inputs preventing someone from inserting any code that a program isn’t expecting.

- Several ways to escape user inputs:
    

- Prepared statements: a coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on to a database
    
- Input sanitization: programming that removes user input which could be interpreted as code
    
- Input validation: programming that ensures user input meets a system’s expectations. 
    

Threat Modeling

>> The process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats

- We apply threat modeling to everything we protect. Entire systems, applications or business processes all get examined from this security related perspective.
    

>> Creating threat models is a lengthy and detailed activity, which is typically done by a collection of individuals with years of experience in the field. 

- Because of this, it’s considered to be an advanced skill in cybersecurity. 
    
- However, that doesn’t mean analysts won’t be involved. 
    

Threat Modeling Steps

1. Define the scope
    
2. Identify threats - internal or external
    

1. Attack Trees
    

4. Characterize the environment
    

1. Apply Attacker mindset to the environment
    

6. Analyze threats

2. Lessons learned 
    

Attack Tree - a diagram that maps threats to assets

PASTA: The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

>> Seven stages of the PASTA framework:

1. Define business and security objectives
    

1. Decide what your goals are
    

3. Define the technical scope
    

1. Identify application components that must be evaluated
    

5. Decompose the Application
    

1. Identify existing controls that will protect user data from threats
    

7. Perform a threat analysis
    

1. Attacker mindset – research on types of attacks being used
    

9. Perform vulnerability analysis
    

1. Deeply investigates potential vulnerabilities by considering the root of the problem
    

11. Conduct attack modeling
    

1. Test vulnerabilities that were analyzed in stage five by simulating attacks
    

13. Analyze risk and impact
    

1. Assemble the information they’ve collected in stages one through six
    
2. By this stage, the team is in position to make informed risk management recommendations to business stakeholders
    

Traits of an Effective Threat Model

>> Threat modeling is the process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities and how each is exposed to threats.

- Strategic approach that combines various security activities, such as vulnerability management, threat analysis and incident response. 
    

>> Traditionally, threat modeling is associated with the field of application development. In this reading we will learn about common threat modeling frameworks that are used to design software that can withstand attacks.

Why Application Security Matters

>> Applications have become an essential part of many organization’s success. For example, web-based applications allow customers from anywhere in the world to connect with businesses, their partners and other customers.

- Smartphones are often the main way information is exchanged between a business and it’s customers. 
    

Defending the Application Layer

- Requires proper testing to uncover weaknesses that can lead to risk. Threat modeling is one of the primary ways to ensure that an application meets security requirements. 
    
- DevSecOps teams usually perform these tasks.
    

>> typical threat modeling process performed in a cycle:

- Define the scope
    
- Identify threats
    
- Characterize the environment
    
- Analyze threats
    
- Mitigate risks
    
- Evaluate findings
    

>> Ideally, threat modeling is performed before, during and after an application is developed. However, conducting a thorough software analysis takes time and resources. 

- As a result, a number of threat modeling frameworks have been developed over the years to make the process smoother
    

Common Threat Modeling Frameworks

- STRIDE
    
- PASTA

- VAST
    

Organizations might use any one of these to gather intelligence and make decisions to improve their security posture.

STRIDE

>> Threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft. Commonly used to identify vulnerabilities is six specific attack vectors.

- Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
    

PASTA

>> Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis is a risk-centric threat modeling process developed by two OWASP leaders and supported by a cybersecurity firm called VerSprite.

- Main focus is to discover evidence of viable threats and represent this information as a model
    
- Seven stage process consists of various activities that incorporate relevant security artifacts of the environment, like vulnerability assessment reports.
    

Trike

>> Open-source methodology and tool that takes a security centric approach to threat modeling. 

- Commonly used to focus on security permissions, application use cases, privilege models and other elements that support a secure environment
    

VAST

>> The Visual, Agile and Simple Threat modeling framework is part of an automated threat modeling platform called ThreatModeler. Many security teams opt to use VAST as a way of automating and streamlining their threat modeling assessments.

Participating in Threat Modeling

>> Often done by experience security professionals, but it's almost never done alone.

- Programs are complex systems responsible for handling a lot of data and processing a variety of commands from users and other systems. 
    

>> One of the keys to threat modeling is asking the right questions:

- What are we working on?
    
- What kinds of things can go wrong?
    
- What are we doing about it?
    
- Have we addressed everything?
    
- Did we do a good job?
