**Key Cybersecurity Terms and Concepts**

> Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches

> Security Frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and

> Security Controls - safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture. 

> Threat Actor or malicious attacker - any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks and data. 

> Internal threat - can be current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access. 

> Network Security - the practice of keeping an orgs network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network. 

> Cloud security - the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured or set up correctly, and access to those assets us limited to authorized users. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications and infrastructure in the cloud.

> Programming - is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include: 

- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Reviewing web traffic
- Alerting suspicious activity

**Core Skills for Cybersecurity**

> Intrusion detection systems (IDS) - used to monitor system activity and alerts for possible intrusions. It’s important to become familiar with IDSs because they’re a key tool that every organization uses to protect assets and data. 

> Incident Response - Cybersecurity analysts need to be able to follow established policies and procedures to respond to incidents appropriately. An analyst may be alerted of a malware attack, then follow the organizations’ policy and procedures to start the incident response process. This could involve conducting an investigation to identify the root issue and establish a way to remediate it.

> Threat Landscape Knowledge

- Being aware of current trends related to threat actors, malware or threat methodologies is vital.
- Allows security teams to build stronger defenses against threat actor tactics and techniques. 
- Being up to date on new threats allows a security analyst to recognize when new types of threats emerge such as a new ransomware variant.

Past Cybersecurity Attacks

> Computer virus: malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software

- Attaches itself to programs or documents on a computer
- More commonly referred to as malware

> Brain virus & Mohrs Worm

- Developers underestimated the impact their malware would have

> Brain Virus 

- Once a person used a pirated copy of the software, malware was installed on the hosts computer. After a while, the virus spread to a lot of devices due to the virus being active once a user inserted the infected disk into their optical drive.
- Spread globally within a couple of months
- Slowed down productivity and business operations

> Morris Worm

- 1988, a program was created and crawled the web to determine amount of connected computers
- Continued to reinstall itself on infected systems and eventually caused the computers to run out of memory

Attacks in the Digital Age

- With the expansion of high speed internet, connected computers increased dramatically

> Love Letter Attack

- Stole internet login credentials
- Targeted and infected people who did not develop a healthy suspicious for unsolicited emails
- Emails had attachment called “Love Letter” that when opened, infected the system with malware and sent itself to contacts within the opener’s address book
- Infected 45 million computers and caused $10 Billion in damages
- Relies on social engineering

> Regular security trainings can prevent social engineering attacks

- Phishing - use of digital communications to trick people into giving up sensitive information or to open infected links

> Equifax Breach

- 143 million customer records were stolen
- Affected 40% of all Americans

- Home addresses, credit card numbers, social security numbers and driver’s licenses were all gathered by attackers and presumably stored in a database

- Equifax fumbled the bag and failed to prevent the breach and failed to address known vulnerabilities
- Paid $575 million to the US government to resolve customer complaints and fines

> Understanding malware and social engineering risks will allow you to communicate risks during future job interviews

> Understanding how security affects people’s lives.

Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness

Phishing - use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

- **Business Email Compromise** - Threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information in order to obtain a financial advantage.
- **Spear Phishing** - malicious email attack targeted at a particular user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source
- **Whaling** - A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing** - The exploitation of electronic device communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- Smishing - The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source.

**Malware** - software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, organization or territory.

- Viruses - Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. 

- When the malicious attachment is open or downloaded, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. 
- Once the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert it’s own code (payload) to damage or destroy data in the system.
- Worms - Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across the systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. 
- Worms self replicate and spreads from an infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- Ransomware - A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an orgs data and demand payment to restore access.
- Spyware - Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to colelct personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings and locations. 

**Social Engineering** 

> Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. 

- Threat actor’s main goal is to create an environment of false trust and ies to exploit as many people as possible.

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include: 

- Social media phishing: a threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites, then initiate an attack.
- Watering hole attack - a threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- USB Baiting- A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB Stick for an employee to find and install, unknowingly infecting a network.

- “Rubber Duckies”

- Physical Social Engineering: threat actor impersonates an employee, customer or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location

**Social Engineering Principles**

> Humans are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. 

Threat actors appeal to certain psychological aspects of humans to gain the upper hand and pull off exploits:  
  
- Authority - Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. People have been conditioned to respect authority and are more trusting of authority figures in general.

- Intimidation - Bullying tactics. Persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

- Consensus/Social Proof - Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use other’s trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.

- Scarcity - A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply
- Familiarity - Establish fake emotion connections with users to exploit them
- Trust - Establish emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use the trust to gain information.
- Urgency - Attempts to persuade others to respond quickly and without questioning. 

#### **Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains, Part 1**

> Security domains are organized into 8 smaller domains to organize work of security professionals.

**Domain 1: Security and Risk Management:**

- Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
- Analysts may need to update company policies based on federal regulations like HIPPA

**Domain 2: Asset Security**

- Secures digital and physical assets. 
- Also related to the storage, maintenance, retention and destruction of data.
- Ensuring old equipment is destroyed properly

Domain 3: Security Architecture and engineering

- Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place
- E.g. configuring a firewall, servers and networks

**Domain 4: Communication and Network Security**

- Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications
- Noticing and correcting vulnerabilities
- Create network policies to mitigate exposure

**Domain 5: Identity and Access Management**

- Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications
- Setting up employee keycard access

**Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing**

- Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities
- May conduct regular audits of user permissions
- Access to payroll info is limited to certain employees

**Domain 7: Security Operations**

- Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures
- Alert that an unknown device has connected to a network

**Domain 8: Software Development Security**

- Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.

**Attack Types**

> A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data.

Some forms of password attacks that we’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:

- Brute force
- Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

**Social Engineering Attack**

- Malicious USB cable
- Malicious flash drive
- Card cloning and skimming

**Adversarial AI Attacks**

- Techniques that manipulate artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

Supply-chain Attacks

- Targets systems, apps, hardware and software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. 
- These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them.
- Supply-chain attacks can full under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

Cryptographic Attack

- Affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are:

- Birthday

Understand Attackers

> Threat actors are any group or person that represents a security risk.

Threat Actor Types

> Advanced Persistent Threats

- Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization’s network without authorization.
- APTs tend to research their targets (large corporations or government entities)
- Motivations include:
- Damaging critical infrastructure (power grid and natural resources)
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

**Insider Threats**

- Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Hackers are people that use computers to gain access to computer systems, networks or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers.

- Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations.
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
- Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. 

- Hackers often fall into more than one of these categories.

> New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

- To learn and enhance their hacking skills
- To seek revenge
- To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts and other tactics

> Other types of hackers are not motivated by anything other than completing the job they were contracted to do. 

- These types of hackers can be considered both ethical and unethical hackers, known to complete both legal and illegal tasks for pay. 
- There are also vigilante hackers, who protect the world from unethical hackers

#### Module 3

> Security Frameworks and controls

> Ethics of security

**Introduction to Security Frameworks and Controls**

> Identify orgs critical assets and risks, then implement necessary frameworks and controls.
> Security lifecycle: a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws

> Several security frameworks that may be used to manage different ypes of organizational and regulatory compliance risks. 

- Purpose of security frameworks include protecting personally identifiable information, known as PII, securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and align security with business goals.

**Purpose of Security Frameworks**

- Protecting PII
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organizational risks

Components of Security Frameworks

1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals.
3. Strong security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

**Security Controls**

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

> Confidentiality - who can access the data and why?

> Integrity - authentic and reliable and correct

> Availability - data is accessible to those authorized to access it

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**

- Voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk
- Examples of the frameworks include the NIST CSF and the NIST Risk Management Framework

.> Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing strong security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

**Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)**

- These organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. 
- Legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC.

**Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)**

- US Federal Government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring and handling of cloud services and product offerings. 
- Purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third party cloud providers

**Center for Internet Security***
- CIS is a non-profit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. 
- CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs.

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

- EU general data regulation that protects the processing of EU residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of EU territory.
- If an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an EU citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. 
- If a breach occurs that concerns an EU citizen’s data, that breach must be disclosed within 72 hours.

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

- International Security Standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud.

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)**

- US federal law established to protect patient’s health information
- Governed by three rules:

1. Privacy
2. Security
3. Breach information

- Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if a patient's Protected Health Information is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud.

International Organization for Standardization

- ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste and services.

**System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)**

- The American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) auditing board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization’s user access policies at different organizational levels such as:

- Associate
- Manager
- Supervisor
- Executive
- Vendor
- Others

- Used to assess an organization's financial compliance and levels of risk.
- Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

> Pro-Tip: There are a number of regulations that are frequently revised. You are encouraged to keep up to date with changes and explore more frameworks, controls and compliance.

**United States Presidential Executive Order 14028**

- Presidential order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity. 
- Directed toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to US critical infrastructure.

**Ethics in Cybersecurity**

- Your job in the cybersecurity field is to remain unbiased and maintain security and confidentiality.

**Security Ethics** 

- Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional
- Just because you have access, does it mean you should abuse it?

**Ethical principles in Security**

- Confidentiality
- Privacy Protections
- Laws

Confidentiality - you will encounter PII and other private info. It is your job to handle it in confidence.

Privacy Protections - safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.

Laws - rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a government or regulatory agency. 

Ethical Concerns Related to Cyberattacks

> In the US, deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

- You can only defend. The act of counterattacking in the US is perceived as an act of vigilantism.
- Counterattacks can lead to additional escalation and harm.

International Standpoint on Counterattacks

> The International Court of Justice (ICJ) states that a person can counterattack if:

- The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial actor to stop
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.

> Organizations do not typically counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure.

Ethical principles and methodologies

> Because counterattacks are illegal, the security realm has created frameworks and controls - such as the confidentiality, integrity and availability triad - to address issues of confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws.
