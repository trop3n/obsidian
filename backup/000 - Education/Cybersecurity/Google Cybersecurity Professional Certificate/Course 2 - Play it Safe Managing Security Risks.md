> CISSP’s eight security domains

> Security frameworks and controls - NIST

> Security audits

> Basic security tools

Module 1: CISSP Security Domains

- 8 different domains that help organizations build a coherent security posture.
    

> Security Posture:

- An organization’s ability to manage it’s defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.
    

> Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

- Focused on:
    

- Defining security goals and objectives
    
- Risk Mitigation
    
- Compliance
    
- Business continuity
    
- Legal regulations
    
- Professional and organizational ethics
    

- Defining security goals and objectives
    

- Risk Mitigation
    

- Process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach
    

- Compliance
    

- Used to develop an organization’s internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards
    

- Business Continuity
    

- Relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans
    

- Legal regulations
    

- Following rules and expectations for ethical behavior to minimize negligence, abuse or fraud.
    

> Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as part of their security and risk management program, based on their perceived needs or risks. InfoSec design processes include:

- Incident Response
    
- Vulnerability Management
    
- Application Security
    
- Cloud Security
    
- Infrastructure Security
    

> Domain 2: Asset Security

- Focused on securing digital and physical assets. 
    
- Also related to the storage, maintenance, retention and destruction of data.
    
- Loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data exposure will depend on the level of risk.
    

- Security impact analysis
    
- Recovery plan
    
- Managing data exposure
    
- Creating backups
    

> SPII and PII should be securely handled and protected

- Organizations need to have policies and procedures that ensure data is properly stored, maintained, retained and destroyed.
    

> Disposal of Data

- Destruction of data properly ensures it can’t be accessed by threat actors.
    

> Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering

- Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place to protect an organization’s assets and data.
    
- Ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place helps protect and organization’s assets and data. 
    

- Security architects and engineers create these processes.
    

> Shared Responsibility

- All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security
    
- Having policies that encourage people to recognize and report can mitigate security issues
    

> Additional Design Principles Related to Domain 3:

- Threat modeling
    
- Least privilege
    
- Defense in depth
    
- Fail security
    
- Separation of duties
    
- Keep it simple
    
- Zero trust
    
- Trust but verify
    

> Domain 4: Communication and Network Security

- Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications
    

- On-site, remote and cloud communications
    
- Organizations with hybrid, remote and on-site remote environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external conditions to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an org’s network is a challenge. 
    

- Secure networks keep an organization's communication and data safe
    

- Employees working remotely in public spaces need to be protected from threats outside of their normal work environment
    

> Domain 5: Identity and Access Management

- Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets
    

- Limit user access to what certain employees need
    
- Do not escalate privileges to users who do not routinely need them
    
- Reduce overall risks to systems and data
    

- User identities are trusted and authenticated and access to physical and logical access is authorized
    
- IAM uses what is referred to as least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. 
    

> 4 man components of IAM:

1. Identification - user verifies who they are
    
2. Authentication - verification process, passwords pin
    
3. Authorization - after a user’s identity has been confirmed
    
4. Accountability - monitoring and recording user actions
    

> Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing

- Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities
    
- Assessment and testing helps organizations find better ways to combat and mitigate threats, risks and vulnerabilities
    
- Suggests that organizations employ penetration testers to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor. 
    

> Domain 7: Security Operations

- Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures
    
- Investigations begin once an incident has been identified
    

- Requires a high degree of urgency
    
- The faster the response to limit damage, the less cost is incurred
    

- A digital forensic investigation must be done to identify how, why and when a breach occurred
    
- Includes strategies, processes and tools such as:
    

- Training and awareness
    
- Reporting and documentation
    
- Intrusion detection and prevention
    
- SIEM tools
    
- Log management
    
- Incident management
    
- Playbooks
    
- Post-breach forensics
    
- Reflecting on lessons learned
    

Software Development Security

- Focuses on using secure coding practices and guidelines to create secure applications
    
- Secure applications help deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users
    
- Recommended guidelines to make secure applications and services
    
- By ensuring that each phase of the software development process was done with security in mind, security can be fully integrated into the software. 
    

- Penetration testing to ensure software has met security and performance standards is essential
    

Threats, Risks and Vulnerabilities

- Assets are items perceived as having value to an organization
    

- Org’s acquire all types of assets, including:
    

- Physical office spaces
    
- Computers
    
- Customers PII
    
- Intellectual property, like patents or copyright data
    

- A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. One example of a threat is a social engineering attack. 
    

- Insider threats: staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.
    
- Advanced persistent threats (APTs): a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.
    
- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access or valuables.
    
- Malicious links in emails that look like they’re from legitimate companies or people is one method of social engineering known as phishing. 
    

- Phishing is a technique used to acquire sensitive data, like usernames, passwords and banking information.
    

Risks are different from threats. 

- A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. 
    
- External Risk: anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, including:
    
- Internal Risk: A current or former employee, vendor or trusted partner who poses a security risk.
    
- Legacy Systems: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems.
    
- Multiparty risk: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.
    
- Software Compliance/Licensing: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner.
    

> NIST provides a comprehensive list of cybersecurity risks. Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the top 10 most critical security risks.

  

- Risks are anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset. 
    
- “The likelihood of a threat occuring.”
    
- Orgs take risks at different levels, from low, medium and high, depending on the type of assets.
    
- A low risk asset is info that would not harm the org’s reputation or ongoing operations, and not cause financial damage
    
- A medium risk asset might include information that’s not available to the public and may cause some damage to the org’s finances, reputation or operations.
    
- A high risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which is compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization’s finances, ongoing ops, or reputation.
    

  

- Common strategies used to manage risks:
    

- Acceptance - accepting risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
    
- Avoidance - creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
    
- Transference - transferring risk to a third party to manage
    
- Mitigation - lessening the impact of a known risk
    

- Vulnerabilities -  weaknesses that can be exploited by an attacker
    

- ProxyLogon: pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code remotely.
    
- ZeroLogon: Vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person’s identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website’s location.
    
- Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code. 
    
- PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). A theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate authentication requests.
    
- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it
    
- Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources, allowing them to steal data.
    
- A weakness that can be exploited by an attacker. 
    
- Both a vulnerability and a threat must be present in order for there to be a risk.
    
- Examples of vulnerabilities include:
    

- Outdated firewall
    
- Software or applications
    
- Weak passwords
    
- Unprotected confidential data
    
- People
    

- Entry-level analysts need to educate and empower people to be more security conscious. 
    

- Teaching people how to identify a phishing email is a great starting point.
    
- Encourage employees to report suspicious activity
    

  
  

Key Impacts of Threats, Risks and Vulnerabilities

> Ransomware

- A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access.
    
- Ransomware can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable
    
- Attackers demand ransom, then provide an encryption key to restore data and access.
    

> Dark Web

- The web is made up of different interlinked network layers:
    

- Surface
    
- Deep Web - requires authorization to access (organization intranet)
    
- Dark Web - accessed by using special software, carries negative connotations
    

> Key Impacts:

- Financial impact:
    

- Interrupted production and operations
    
- Financial cost of restoring access/ops
    
- Fines incurred if data is lost, stolen or mishandled
    

- Identity Theft
    

- Storing any sensitive data presents a risk to an organization
    
- Information can be sold on the dark web, due to the secretive nature of the dark web.
    

- Reputational
    

- Exploited vulnerabilities can undermine public trust in an organization
    

  

NIST Risk Management Framework

> National Institute of Standards and Technology

- There are seven steps in the RMF:
    

1. Prepare
    
2. Categorize
    
3. Select
    
4. Implement
    
5. Assess
    
6. Authorize
    
7. Monitor
    

  

1. Prepare
    

- Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
    

3. Categorize
    

- Used to develop risk management processes and tasks
    

5. Select
    

- CHoose, customize and capture documentation of the controls that protect and organization
    
- E.g. keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently
    

7. Implement
    

- Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks.
    

9. Assess
    

- Assess means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly
    
- Orgs want to operate as efficiently as possible
    
- It’s important to take time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures and controls that are in palace are meeting organizational needs.
    

1. Identify potential weaknesses
    

11. Authorize
    

- Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization’s security goals.
    

13. Monitor
    

- Be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. 
    
- Know how the current systems support the organizations needs
    
- If the system in place doesn’t meet the security goals, changes may be needed
    

Section 2, Module 2: Frameworks

 > Security Frameworks act as a starting point to create their own security policies and guidelines

> Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

> Security involves more than just the digital space, it also includes the physical.

- People are the biggest threat to security
    

- Educate employees is the best way to create a security culture and give employees awareness on how they can protect themselves, their coworkers and their organization
    
- Train them how to spot red flags, potential threats and have plans in place to quickly report and address security concerns. 
    

  

Security Controls

> Controls are used to reduce specific risks. If proper controls are not in place, an organization could face significant financial impacts and damage to their reputation because of exposure to risks including trespassing, creating fake employee accounts, or providing free benefits.

- Security Controls: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
    

> Three main security controls covered in this course:

1. Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
    

1. Typically, encryption involves converting data from plaintext to ciphertext.
    
2. Ciphertext is the raw, encoded message that’s unreadable to humans and computers. Ciphertext cannot be read until it has been decrypted into its original plaintext form.
    

3. Authentication is the process of verifying who someone or something is. 
    

1. A real-world example of authentication is loggin into a website with your username and password. 
    
2. Multifactor Authentication is a more advanced form of authentication that challenges the user to demonstrate that they are who they claim to be by using an additional security code or biometric data.
    
3. Biometrics are unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person’s identity. 
    

1. Eye scan, fingerprint, palm scans, face ID.
    
2. Vishing is a social engineering tactic that can be used to obtain sensitive information to steal someone’s identity to commit a crime
    

5. Authorization refers to the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.
    

1. Used to verify that a person has permission to access a resource
    
2. Certain employees or individuals will only have certain permissions based on their security clearance, job duties or title.
    

The Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

> Security Frameworks support an organizaiton’s ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.

- Healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, requiring that medical professionals keep medical records and patient information safe.
    

> Security Controls are measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.

- Healthcare industry professionals are often required to use MFA along with their patients to better protect medical records. 
    

Specific Frameworks and Controls

> Cyber Threat Framework

- Developed by the US government to provide a “common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.”
    
- By standardizing language, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.
    

> International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001

- Enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial info, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties.
    

- Outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices and controls that support an org’s ability to manage risks.
    

> Controls

- Used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of security threats
    
- Controls can be physical, technical and administrative
    

> Examples of Physical Controls:

- Gates, fences and locks
    
- Security guards
    
- CCTV networks, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
    
- Access cards or badges
    

> Examples of Technical Controls

- Firewalls
    
- MFA
    
- Antivirus software
    

> Examples of administrative controls

- Separation of duties
    
- Authorization
    
- Asset classification
    

Explore the CIA Triad

> Model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies

> Three letters of the CIA triad:

1. Confidentiality
    
2. Integrity
    
3. Accessibility
    

> Confidentiality

- Means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data
    
- Sensitive data should be available on a need to know basis
    
- Confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the principle of least privilege. 
    

- Least privilege limits user’s access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks.
    

> Integrity

- The data is correct, authentic and reliable
    
- One way to verify data is through cryptography.
    

- Used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it. 
    

- Enabling encryption, which is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
    

> Availability

- Data is available to those who are authorized to access it
    
- Ensuring systems are functioning properly so that authorized users can access their data in a timely and efficient manner provides good security practice while ensuring operations carry on as normal
    
- An example would be allowing remote employees to access its internal network to perform their jobs. 
    

- An accounting employee may need financial data, but not data related to ongoing development projects. 
    

NIST Frameworks

> NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

- Voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk
    

> CSF consists of 5 important core functions:

1. Identify
    
2. Protect
    
3. Detect
    
4. Respond
    
5. Recover
    

> NIST S.P. 800-53

- A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government
    

> The Five Functions of the NIST CSF:

1. Identify:
    

1. The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on its people and assets. 
    

3. Protect
    

1. Strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats
    

5. Detect
    

1. Identify potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
    

7. Respond
    

1. Making sure the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process
    

9. Recover
    

1. The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation
    

  
  
  
  

OWASP Security Principles

> Open Web Application Security Project

> First OWASP Principle: Minimize Attack Surface Area

- Minimize the attack surface area
    
- To minimize the attack surface and avoid incidents from these types of vectors, security teams might disable software features, restrict who can access certain assets, or establish more complex password requirements
    

> Second OWASP Principle: Least Privilege 

- means making sure that users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks. The main reason for limiting access to organizational information and resources is to reduce the amount of damage a security breach can cause. 
    

> Third OWASP Principle: Defense in Depth

- Defense in Depth means that an organization should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways.
    

- Multi-factor authentication, firewalls, IDS and permission settings are examples of options used to create multiple points of defense an attacker has to breach.
    

> Fourth OWASP Principle: Separation of Duties

- Used to prevent individuals from carrying out fraudulent or illegal activities.
    
- Means that no one should be given so many privileges that they can misuse them. 
    

- The person who signs paychecks shouldn’t be the person that prepares them.
    

> Fifth OWASP Principle: Keep Security Simple

- Avoid unnecessary complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.
    

> Sixth OWASP Principle: Fix Security Issues Correctly

- When security issues occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure the remediation is successful.
    

Additional OWASP Security Principles

> Establish Secure Defaults

- The optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application secure.
    

> Fail Securely

- When a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its more secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything. 
    

> Don’t Trust Services

- Third party partners often have different security policies than the organization does. The organization shouldn’t simply trust that their partner’s systems are secure. 
    

> Avoid Security by Obscurity

- The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.
    

Plan a Security Audit

- Review of an organization’s security controls, policies and procedures against a set of expectations.
    
- Two main types of security audits:
    

- External
    
- Internal
    

- Internal audits are typically conducted by a team of people that might include an organizations compliance officer, security manager, or other security team members. 
    

- Internal audits are used to help improve an organization's security posture and help organizations avoid fines from governing bodies. 
    

- Common Security Audit Elements:
    

- Establishing the scope and goals of the audit. 
    
- Conducting risk assessment of the organization’s assets.
    
- Completing a controls assessment
    
- Assessing compliance
    
- Communicating risks to shareholders
    
- Scope
    

- Specific criteria of an internal security audit
    
- Requires organizations to identify people, assets, policies, procedures and technologies that impact an organization’s security posture
    
- Goals -
    
- Outline of the organization’s security objectives, or what they want to achieve in order to improve their security posture. 
    

Completing a Security Audit

> Factors that can affect audits

- Industry type
    
- Organization size
    
- Ties to the applicable government regulations
    
- A business’s geographical location
    
- Business decision to adhere to a specific regulatory compliance
    

> Ask yourself some questions before beginning the security audit.

- What is the audit meant to achieve?
    
- Which assets are most at risk?
    
- Are current controls sufficient to protect such assets?
    
- If not, which assets are most at risk?
    
- If not, what controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?
    

> Controls Assessment

- Close review of an organization’s existing assets, then evaluating potential risks to those assets, to ensure internal controls and processes are effective. 
    

- Classifying controls into the following categories:
    

- Administrative controls, technical controls, and physical controls
    

> Administrative Controls

- Related to the human component of cybersecurity
    
- Policies that define how an organization manages data
    

> Technical Controls

- Hardware and software solutions used to protect assets, such as the use of IDS, and encryption
    

> Physical Controls

- Physical controls refer to measures put in place to prevent physical access to protected assets, such as surveillance cameras and locks
    

- The next element is determining whether or not the organization is adhering to necessary compliance regulations.
    

- Each organization will likely have their own set of regulations to adhere to, based on the type of business or company that is operated.
    

- The final element of a security audit is the communication.
    

- Results and recommendations need to be communicated to stakeholders.
    
- Provides a general summary of the scope and goals of the audit.
    
- Lists existing risks and how quickly they need to be addressed. 
    
- IDentifies compliance regulations the organization needs to adhere to and provides recommendations for improving the organization’s security posture. 
    

Audit Checklist

1. Identify the scope of the audit:
    

1. The audit should:
    

1. List assets that will be addressed
    
2. Note how the audit will help the organization achieve it’s desired goals
    
3. Indicate how often an audit should be performed
    
4. Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees
    

3. Complete a risk assessment
    

1. Risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal process, and external standards
    

5. Create a mitigation plan
    

1. A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture
    

7. Communicate results to stakeholders
    

1. The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to
    

  
  
  

Module 3: Security Tools

> Logs

> SIEM Dashboards

> SIEM Tools

SIEM Logs, Logs

- Common log sources:
    

- Firewall logs
    
- Network logs
    
- Server logs
    

- Firewall logs:
    

- A record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet
    
- It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network
    

-  Network logs:
    

- Record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network.
    

- Server log:
    

- Record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares. 
    
- Includes actions such as login, password and username requests.
    

> Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tool 

- Application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization
    
- Index and minimize the amount of logs an analyst must manually review and analyze, they increase efficiency and save time.
    
- SIEM tools must be customized to fit an organization’s needs
    

- This is a continual process to be iterated on as threats emerge
    

> SIEM Dashboards

- Dashboards present information in a format that’s easy to read and understand.
    
- Visual representations of activity and timelines
    
- Comprehensive summaries of security related data
    
- SIEM dashboards provide stakeholders with different metrics, which are key technical attributes such as response time, availability and failure rate
    

The Future of SIEM Tools

> Current SIEM solutions

- Provides security data to help cybersecurity team members manage and monitor organizational data. 
    
- Currently, all SIEM tools require human interaction at various places.
    

> The Future of SIEM tools

- Cloud-functionality is the latest development for the majority of SIEM tools
    
- Cloud tools are simply accessed through the internet and do not rely on local executable files 
    
- Managed by vendors who are responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure required to use the tools (servers, networks, etc.)
    
- IoT device proliferation represents a new challenge to cybersecurity analysts and 
    
- AI and machine learning will continue to advance SIEM technology to better identify threat-related terminology, dashboard visualization, and data storage.
    
- Implementation of automation will help security teams respond faster to possible incidents, performing many actions without waiting for a human response. Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of apps, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. 
    

- This frees up analysts to deal with more intensive and uncommon incidents that cannot be automated.

- Require orgs to install, operate and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity.
    
- Applications are then managed by the orgs IT department, rather than a third party vendor
    
- Ideal for organizations required to maintain physical control over confidential data.
    
-   
    

- Cloud-hosted SIEM
    

- Maintained by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet. 
    
- Ideal for organizations that don’t want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure. 
    

- Hybrid Self/Cloud hosting
    

- Choose a hybrid SIEM solution to get the benefits of the cloud while also maintaining physical control over data.

- Goal is to provide users with tools that are built by the public in a collaborative way, which can result in the software being more secure. 
    
- Software engineers create open-source projects to improve software and make it available for anyone to use.
    

> Proprietary Tools

- Developed and owned by a person or company. 
    
- Users need to wait for updates to be made to the software, and at times they might need to pay a fee for those updates. 
    
- Proprietary softwares generally allow users to modify a limited number of features to meet org and individual needs
    

> Common Misconceptions

- It is generally believed that open-source tools are less effective and not as safe to use as proprietary tools. 
    
- Several open source materials have become industry standard over the years.
    
- The open-source community of well-intentioned and informed users makes manipulation attempts by threat actors more difficult, because those users can fix issues as soon as they’re identified

Section 2, Module 4: Playbooks

> Phases of an incident response playbook

- Playbook: a manual that provides details about any operational action
    
- What tools should be used in a security incident?
    

> Playbooks ensure that responders follow a consistent list of actions in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case.

> Playbooks also list what tools should be used in a security incident

> Playbooks are typically managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise

- Updates are often made if:
    

- A failure is identified, such as an oversight in outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself
    
- There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance
    
- The cybersecurity landscape has changed due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques 
    

> Playbooks sometimes cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities. These might include ransomware, vishing, business email compromise and other attacks previously discussed. Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are very common, but not the only types of playbooks used.

> If any forensic task in being carried out, mishandling data can easily compromise forensic data, rendering it unusable. 

> Incident Response

- Organization’s quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach
    
- Six phases used to mitigate and respond to a cybersecurity incident as it occurs
    

> Six Phases of Incident Response

1. Preparation 
    

1. Prepare to minimize the likelihood, risk and impact of a security incident by:
    

1. Documenting procedures
    
2. Establishing staffing plans
    
3. Educating users
    

3. Preparation sets the foundation for successful incident response
    

3. Detection and Analysis
    

1. Detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology.
    
2. Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase will help security analysts determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude
    

5. Containment
    

1. Prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident
    
2. Take actions to contain an incident and minimize damage
    
3. High priority because it helps prevent ongoing risks
    

7. Eradication and Recovery
    

1. Complete removal of an incident’s artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operations
    
2. Removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities
    
3. Once due diligence is exercised, the affected environment can be restored to a secure state, known as IT Restoration
    

9. Post-Incident Activity
    

1. Documenting the incident, informing organizational leadership
    
2. Applying lessons learned to ensure than an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents
    
3. Depending on scale, organizations can conduct a full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and implement updates or improvements to the security posture
    

11. Coordination
    

1. Reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process, based on established standards
    
2. Ensures that compliance requirements are met and allows for coordinated response and resolution
    

Using a Playbook to Respond to Threats

- An incident response playbook is a guide that helps security professionals mitigate issues with a heightened sense of urgency, while maintaining accuracy.
    
- Playbooks create structure, ensure compliance and outline processes for communication and documentation.
    
- Organizations may use different types of incident response playbooks depending on the situation.
    

- Specific playbooks for different attacks, like ransomware, malware, distributed denial of service, and more
    

> The first action in the playbook is to assess the alert.

- Determine if the alert is valid by identifying why the alert was generated by the SIEM.
    

- Done using log analysis and related metrics
    

- Use the outlined actions and tools to use to contain the malware and reduce further damage.
    

- Isolate, or disconnect, the infected network system to prevent the malware from spreading into other parts of the network
    

- After containing the incident, step three describes ways to eliminate all traces of the incident and restore the affected systems back to normal operations. 
    

- For example, the playbook might instruct the analyst to restore the impacted operating system, then restore the affected data using a clean backup, created before the malware outbreak.
    

- Once the incident has been resolved, step four of the playbook instructs the analyst to perform various post-incident activities and coordination efforts with the security team. 
    

- Actions may include creating a final report to communicate the security incident to stakeholders, or reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities
    

> Playbooks are living documents, meaning they will evolve over time as frequent changes, updates and improvements are made to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

Playbooks, SIEM and SOAR tools

> Playbooks are generally used alongside SIEM tools, where the SIEM alerts analysts to an issue and the playbook guides the response to that issue.

Playbooks and SOAR tools

> SOAR tools are similar to SIEM tools in that they are used for threat monitoring. SOAR is a piece of software used to automate repetitive tasks generated by tools such as a SIEM or managed detection and response (MDR).

For example, if a user attempts to log into their computer too many times with the wrong password, a SOAR would automatically block their account to stop a possible intrusion.
