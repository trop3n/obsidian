#### Event and Incident Detection

> Security Mindset
> Incident Escalation
> Sensitive nature of data

**Security Mindset**

> Recognize not only what you're defending, but what or who you are defending against.

It's important to recognize the types of assets that are essential to maintaining an organization's business functions, along with types of threats, risks and vulnerabilities that can negatively impact those assets. 

> A **security mindset** is the ability to evaluate risk and constantly seek out and identify the potential or actual breach of a system, application or data. 

Entry level analysts can help protect low level assets, such as an organization's guest WiFi network, and high-importance assets, such as intellectual property, trade secrets, PII and even financial information.

> Your security mindset allows you to protect all levels of assets. 

#### Data and Asset Classification

> Key data classification types and the difference between the low-level and high-level assets of an organization

**Classifying for Safety**
> Security professionals classify data types to help them properly protect and organization from cyber attacks that negatively impact business operations.

Review of the most common data types:

-  **Public Data
-  **Private Data**
-  **Sensitive Data**
-  **Confidential Data**

**Public Data**

> This data classification does not need extra security protections.
> **Public data** is already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization if viewed or shared by others.
> Although it is open to the public, it still needs to be protected from security attacks.

-  Press Releases
-  Job descriptions
-  Marketing materials

**Private Data**

> This data classification type has a higher security level. **Private Data** is information that should be kept from the public. If an individual gains unauthorized access to private data, that evne that the potential to pose a serious risk to an organization

Examples of private data can include:
-  company email addresses
-  employee identification numbers
-  organization's research data

**Sensitive Data**

> This information must be protected from everyone who does not have authorized access. Unauthorized access to sensitive data can cause significant damage to an organization's finances and reputation

**Sensitive Data** includes personally identifiable information, sensitive personally identifiable information, and protected health information. 
-  banking account numbers
-  usernames and passwords
-  social security numbers
-  passwords
-  passport numbers
-  medical information

**Confidential Information**

> This data classification type is important for an organization's ongoing business operations. **Confidential Data** often has limits on the number of people who have access to it.

Access to confidential data sometimes involves the signing of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) -- legal contracts that bind two or more parties to protect information -- to further protect the confidentiality of the data.

Examples of confidential data:
-  trade secrets
-  financial records
-  sensitive government data

#### Asset Classification

> means labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization.
> the classification of an organization's assets ranges from low-level to high-level

Public data is a low level asset
-  It is readily available to the public and will not have a negative impact on an organization if compromised. 

Sensitive data and confidential data are high-level assets. 
-  They can have a significantly negative impact on an organization if leaked publicly. 

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

> Highlight the need to create business continuity and disaster recovery plans to minimize the impact of a security incident on an organization's business operations.

> Analysts need to consider the sequence of steps to be taken by the security team before business continuity and disaster recovery plans are implemented. 

**Identify and Protect**

> Creating business continuity and disaster recovery plans are the final steps of a four-part process that most security teams go through to help ensure the security of an organization

First, the security team identifies the assets that must be protected in the organization.
Next, they determine what potential threats could negatively impact those assets.
After the threats have been determined, the security team implements tools and processes to detect potential threats to assets. 
Lastly, the IT or appropriate business function creates the business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

**Business Continuity Plan**

> The impact of successful security attacks on an organization can be significant. Loss of profits and customers are two possible outcomes that organizations never want to happen.

**Business continuity plans** are documents that outline the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption. 
-  It is created alongside a disaster recovery plan to minimize the damage of a successful security attack. 

Four essential steps for business continuity plans:

-  **Conduct a business impact analysis**: The business impact analysis step focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions can have on an organization
- **Identify, document, and implement steps to recover critical business functions and processes.** This step helps the business continuity team create actionable steps toward responding to a security event.
- **Organize a business continuity team**: This step brings various members of the organization together to help execute the business continuity plan, if it is needed. The members of this team are typically from the cybersecurity, IT, HR, communications and operations departments.
- **Conduct training for the business continuity team**: The team considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during these training exercises.

**Disaster recovery plan**

> a **disaster recovery plan** allows an organization's security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that has stopped the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data. 

It also helps the security team resolve the security threat. A disaster recovery plan is typically created alongside a business continuity plan. 

Steps to create a disaster recovery plan should include:
-  Implementing recovery strategies to restore software
-  Implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality
-  Identifying applications and data that might be impacted after a security incident has taken place.

**Information Lifecycle Strategy.**

-  The first step in the information lifecycle is to identify the important assets to the company, including sensitive customer such as PII, financial information, social security numbers, and EINs
-  The second step is the security measures in place to protect the identified assets and review the company's information security policies.
-  The third step of the information lifecycle is to protect the identified assets of the organization
-  The last step of the information lifecycle is to monitor the security processes that have been implemented to protect the organization's assets. 

# Module 2: Escalation

> Protecting the data and assets of an organization is the primary goal of a security team.
> Recognizing how and when to escalate a security event is crucial for security analysts

> Incident escalation
> Incident classification
> General guidelines for escalating incidents

**The Importance of Escalation**

> **Incident escalation** is the process of identifying a potential security incident, triaging it, and handing it off to a more experienced team member

Not every incident needs to be escalated. 

**Essential skills necessary to escalate security incidents**:
-  Attention to detail
-  Ability to follow an organization's escalation guidelines or processes

### Escalate with a Purpose

> Learn the importance of escalating security issues and the potential impact of failing to escalate an issue.

**Incident Escalation**

> The process of identifying a potential security incident. During this process, potential incidents are transferred to a more experienced department or team member. 

As a security analyst, you'll be expected to recognize potential issues, such as when an employee excessively enters the wrong credentials to their account, and report it to the appropriate person.

**Notification of Breaches**

> Many countries have breach notification laws, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the laws applicable in the area your company is operating in.

Breach notification laws require companies and government entities to notify individuals of security breaches involving PII. 
-  medical records
-  personal identification numbers
-  addresses
-  other sensitive information

**Low-level Security Issues**

> Security risks that do not result in the exposure of PII. These issues can included the following and other risks:
-  An employee having one failed login attempt on their account
-  An employee downloading unapproved software onto their laptop

These are not significant security challenges, but they must be investigated further in case they need to be escalated. An employee typing in a password two or three times might not be of concern. 
If that employee types in a password 15 times in 30 minutes, that could be a potential event.

**The Escalation Process**

> Every company has different processes and procedures, including unique escalation policies. These policies detail who should be notified when a security alert is received and who should be contacted if the first responder is not available. 

> Also describes *how* the incident should be escalated, whether by the IT desk or an incident management tool, or direct communication. 

### To Escalate or not to Escalate

> **Malware Infection**
> 	-  an incident type that occurs when malicious software designed to disrupt a system infiltrates an organization's computer network
> 	-  some infections are simple (phishing), others are much more complex (ransomware)

> **Unauthorized Access**
> 	-  incident type that occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or application without permission
> 	-  **brute force attacks** use trial and error to compromise passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys
> 	-  all unauthorized access incidents should be escalated, but the procedure and urgency depends on how critical the system is to operations

> **Improper Usage**
> 	-  incident type that occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization's  acceptable use policies
> 	-  can be unintentional
> 	-  should always be escalated to a supervisor

### Recognize Roles and Responsibilities During Escalation

> Discuss the roles of the various team members who are a part of the incident escalation process. This will vary from organization to organization.

**Data Owners**

> The person who decides who can access, edit, use or destroy their information. Data owners have administrative control over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for the classification, protection, access and use of company data.

**Data Controllers**

> Determine the procedure and purpose for processing data. This role largely focuses on collecting the personal info of others. The data controller determines how the data is used. 
> 	- also ensures that data is used, stored, and processed in accordance with relevent security and privacy regulations. 

**Data Processors**

> Report directly to the data controller and are responsible for processing the data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor is typically a vendor and is often tasked with installing security measures to help protect the data. 

**Data Custodians**

> Assign and remove access to software or hardware. Custodians are responsible for implementing security controls for the data they are responsible for, granting and revoking access to that data, creating policies regarding how that data is stored and transmitted, advising on potential threats to that data, and monitoring the data.

## Timing is Everything

> The impact of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a manufacturing application or PII is far greater than a forgotten password.

> Knowing the relationship between asset classifications and security incidents.

An **escalation policy** is a set of actions that outline who should be notified when an incident alert occurs and how that incident should be handled.

**Attention to detail** can make the difference between escalating an incident to the right or wrong person. It can also help you prioritize which incidents need to be escalated with more or less urgency. 

### Escalation Timing

> More detail about the role you'll play in protecting an organization's data and assets when it comes to escalating incidents.

**Your Decisions Matter**

Security is a faced paced environment with bad actors constantly trying to compromise an organization's systems and data. 

This means security analysts must be prepared to make daily decisions to help keep a company's data and systems safe. Entry-level security analysts help the security team escalate potential security incidents to the right team members. 

**Trust Your Instincts and Ask Questions**

Confidence is an important attribute for a security analyst to have, especially when it comes to the escalation process. The security team will depend on you to be confident in your decision-making. 

Be intentional about learning the organization's escalation policy. 

Remember to ask questions when necessary.

**All Security Events are Not Equal**

An important part of escalation is recognizing which assets and data are the most important for your organization. You can determine this information by reading through your onboarding materials, asking your supervisor directly about which assets and data are most important., and reviewing your companies security policies. 

**Quick Escalation Tips**:

-  Familiarize yourself with the escalation policy of the organization you work for.
-  Follow the policy at all times.
-  Ask questions.

# Module 3: Stakeholders

> Stakeholders

**Stakeholders:**

-  Risk Managers
-  Chief Executive Officer
-  Chief Financial Officer
-  Chief Information Security Officer
-  Operation Managers

**Risk Manager Responsibilities**:

-  Identify risks
-  Manage the response to security incidents
-  Notify the legal department
-  Inform the organization's public relations team

**Chief Executive Officer Responsibilities:

-  Work directly with analysts
-  Responsible for daily maintenance of security operations

**Stakeholder Communications for Entry-Level Analysts**

> Two examples of security stakeholders with whom you might regularly communicate are operations managers and risk managers. 

When you report to these stakeholders, you'll need to clearly communicate the current security issue and its possible causes. 

The operations managers will then determine next steps and coordinate other team members to remediate or resolve the issue.

For example, you might report multiple failed login attempts by an employee to your operations manager. This stakeholder might contact the employee's supervisor to ensure the occurrence is a genuine issue of entering the wrong password or determine if the account has been compromised. 

**From One Stakeholder to the Next**

> Operations managers and risk managers are stakeholders who rely on entry-level analysts and other team members to keep them informed of security events in day-to-day operations.

These stakeholders commonly report back to the CISOs and CFOs to give broader narratives of the organization's overall security picture. 

### Clear and Concise Communication

Be mindful of:
-  What you communicate
-  Who you communicate to

**Communications should:**

-  Be precise
-  Avoid unnecessary technical terms
-  Have a clear purpose

> they shouldn't have to guess the reason for your email or why it matters to them

**Communicate Effectively with Stakeholders**

> Importance of clearly communicating to stakeholders to ensure they have a thorough understanding of the information you're sharing and why it's meaningful to the organization.

**Get to the Point**

Security stakeholders have roles and responsibilities that are time sensitive and impact the business. 

Any communication they receive, and the actions they need to take, should be clear. 

Ask yourself when communicating:
-  What do I want this person to know?
-  Why is it important for them to know it?
-  When do they need to take action?
-  How do I explain the situation in a nontechnical manner?

**Follow the Protocols**

> When first joining a security team, you'll want to learn about the different protocols and procedures in place for communicating with stakeholders and other members of the organization.

It's important to make sure you know what applications and forms of communications are acceptable before you begin communicating with stakeholders, such as in-person meetings, video-conferencing, emails or company chat applications.

**Communicate with Impact**

> Senior-level stakeholders are more concerned about the underlying risks, and not the technical details of the logs. 

**Communication Methods**

> Your method of communication will vary, depending on the type of information you're sharing. Knowing which communication channels are appropriate for different scenarios is a great skill to help you communicate effectively with stakeholders. 

-  Instant messaging
-  Emailing
-  Video calling
-  Phone calls
-  Sharing a spreadsheet of data
-  Sharing a slideshow presentation
