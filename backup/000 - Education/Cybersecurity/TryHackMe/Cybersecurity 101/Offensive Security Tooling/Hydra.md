## What is Hydra?

Hydra is a brute-force online password cracking program, a quick system login password "hacking" tool.

Hydra can run through a list and "brute force" some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone's password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP).
