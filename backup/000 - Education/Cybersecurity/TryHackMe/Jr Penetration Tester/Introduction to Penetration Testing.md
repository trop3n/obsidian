# What is Penetration Testing?

Before teaching the technical hands-on aspects of ethical hacking, you'll need to understand more about what a penetration tester's job responsibilities are and what processes are followed in performing pentests. 

The importance and relevancy of cybersecurity are ever-increasing and can be in every walk of life. News headlines fill our screens, reporting yet another hack or data leak.

Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect your emails or to businesses and other organizations needing to protect both devices and data from damages. 

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyze the security defenses to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

According to [Security Magazine](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds), a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.

## Penetration Testing Ethics

The battle of legality and ethics in cybersecurity, let alone penetration testing is always controversial. Labels like "hacking" and "hacker" often hold negative connotations, especially in pop culture, thanks to a few bad apples. The idea of legally gaining access to a computer system is a challenging concept to grasp -- after all, what makes it legal activity. 

Recall that a penetration test is an **authorized audit** of a computer system's security and defenses as agreed by the owners of the systems. The legality of a penetration is pretty clear-cut in this sense; anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorized.

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on. This discussion **forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement** and will determine the course the penetration test takes.

Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation. For example, the national Cyber Security Center (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK. This check means that only "[Check approved companies can conduct authorized penetration tests of public sector and CNI systems and networks]". 

Ethics is the **moral debate** between right and wrong; where an action may be legal, it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.

Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. For example, they are gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive data. Or they are, perhaps, performing a phishing attack on an employee to test an organization's human security. If that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal -- however ethically questionable. 

Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into. Let's cove these three in the table below:

| Hat       | Description                                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| White Hat | These hacker's are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skill to benefit others.                    | For example, a penetration tester performing an authorized engagement on a company.          |
| Grey Hat  | These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. | For example, someone taking down a scamming site.                                            |
| Black Hat | These people are criminals and often seek to damage organizations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.       | For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom. |
### Rules of Engagement

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS Institute has a great example of this document [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?).

| Section    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Permission | This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activities they carry out.            |
| Test Scope | This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.        |
| Rules      | The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing are prohibited, but MITM attacks are okay. |
## Penetration Testing Methodologies

Penetration tests can have a wide variety of objectives and targets within scope. Because of this, no penetration test is the same, and there are no one-case fits all as to how a penetration tester should approach it. 

The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the *methodology*. A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand. 

- For example, having a methodology that you would use to test the security of a web application is not practical when you have to test the security of a network. 

Before discussing some different industry standard methodologies, we should note that all of them have a general theme of the following stages:

| Stage                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Gathering | This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organization as possible, for example, OSINT and research. **Note:** this does not involve scanning any systems.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Enumeration/Scanning  | This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Exploitation          | This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Privilege Escalation  | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a **foothold**), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group(i.e. administrator). |
| Post-Exploitation     | This stage involves a few sub-stages:  <br><br>**1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)<br><br>**2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user<br><br>**3.**Â  Covering your tracks<br><br>**4.** Reporting                                                                                                            |

## Black Box, White-Box and Grey-Box

![](https://i.imgur.com/gCjcSmE.png)

There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding of your target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement. In this task, we'll cover these three different scopes of testing.

### Black-Box Testing

This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service. 

The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. This testing can involve interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned. No knowledge of programming or understanding of the program is necessary for this type of testing.

### Grey-Box Testing

This testing process is the most popular for things like penetration testing. It is a combination of both black box and white box testing processes. The tester will have some *limited knowledge* of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

### White-Box Testing

This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time. 

The tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and it's expected behavior and is much more time consuming than black box testing. The full knowledge in a a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated. 

# Principles of Security

The following room is going to outline some of the fundamental principles of information security. The frameworks used to protect data and systems to the elements of what exactly makes data secure.

The measures, frameworks and protocols discussed throughout this room all play a small part in "Defence in Depth."

Defence in Depth is the use of multiple varied layers of security to an organisation's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will provide redundancy in an organisation's security perimeter.

## The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is an information security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy. This model has an extensive background, ranging from being used in 1998.

This history is because the security of information does not start and/or end with cybersecurity, but instead, applies to scenarios like filing, record storage, etc.

Consisting of three sections: **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability**, this model has quickly become the industry standard today. This model should help determine the value of data that it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business.

The CIA tirad is unlike a traditional model where you have individual sections, it is a **continuous cycle**. Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless (similar to the fire triangle). If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy.

Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad are arguably self explanatory, let's explore these and contextualize them into cybersecurity.

### Confidentiality

This element is the **protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse**. Organizations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.

There are many real-world examples for this, for example, employee records and accounting documents will be considered sensitive. Confidentiality will be provided in the sense that only HR administrators will access employee records, where vetting and tight access controls are in place. Accounting records are less valuable (and therefore less sensitive), so not as stringent access controls would be in place for these documents. Or, for example, governments using a sensitivity classification rating system (top-secret, classified, unclassified).

### Integrity

The CIA triad element of integrity is the **condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made**. It is possible for the information to change because of careless access and use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use. In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission and usage not involving modification to the information. Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of condifentiality.)

Many defenses to ensure integrity can be put into place. Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorized users from making unauthorized changes. Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted.

### Availability

In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

The main concern in the CIA triad is that the information should be available when authorized users need to access it.

Availability is very often a key benchmark for an organization. For example, having 99.99% uptime on their websites or systems (this is laid out in Service Level Agreements). When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organization's reputation and loss of finances. Availability is achieved through a combination of many elements, including:

- Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)
- Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
- Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack.

## Principles of Privilege

It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require. 

The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:

- The individual's role/function within the organization
- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals: `Privileged Identity Management (PIM)` and `Privileged Access Management (PAM).`

Initially, these two concepts can seem to overlap; however, they are different from one another. **PIM** is used to translate a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system. **PAM** is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

What is essential when discussing privilege and access controls is the principle of least privilege. Simply, users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are absolutely necessary for them to perform their duties. Other people should be able to trust what people write to. 

As we previously mentioned, PAM incorporates more than assigning access. It also encompasses enforcing security policies such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces.

## Security Models Continued

Before discussing security models further, let's recall the three elements of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. We've previously outlined what these elements are and their importance. However, there is a formal way of achieving this.

According to a security model, any system or piece of technology storing information is called an information system, which is how we will reference systems and devices in this task.

Let's explore some popular and effective security models to achieve the three elements of the CIA triad.

### The Bell-La Padula Model

The Bell-La Padula model is used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumption, such as an organization's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well defined.

The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule **"no write down, no read up."** 

| Advantages                                                                                       | Disadvantages                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organizations hierarchies (and vice versa) | Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect. |
| Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.                        | The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organization.                                                                |

> The Bell LaPadula model is popular within organizations such as governmental and military. This is because members of the organizations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting. **Vetting** is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to the organization. Therefore, applicants who are successfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy - which is where this model fits in.

### Biba Model

The **Biba Model** is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model for the integrity of the CIA triad. 

This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarized as "no write up, no read down". This rule means that subjects **can** create or write content to objects **at or below their level** but **can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level**.

| Advantages                                                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                       |

| This model is simple to implement                                                                          | There will be many levels of access and objects. Things can be easily overlooked when applying security controls.                                   |
| Resolves the limitations of the Bell-LaPadula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity. | Often results in delays within a business. For example, a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model. |

> The Biba model is used in organizations or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality. For example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job. They may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc.

## Threat Modeling and Incident Response

**Threat Modeling** is the process of reviewing, improving and testing the security protocols in place in an organization's information technology infrastructure and services.

A critical stage of the threat modelling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities a system or application may be vulnerable to. 

The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:

- Preparation
- Identification
- Mitigations
- Review

It is, however, a complex process that needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:

- Threat Intelligence
- Asset Identification
- Mitigation Capabilities
- Risk assessment

To help with this, there are frameworks such as **STRIDE** (`Spoofing Identity`, `Tampering with Data`, `Repudiation Threats`, `Information Disclosure`, `Denial of Service`, and `Elevation of Privileges`) and **PASTA** (`Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis`). InfoSec never tasted so good! Let's detail STRIDE below. STRIDE, authored by two Microsoft security researchers in 1999 is still very relevant today. STRIKE includes six main principles, which I have detailed in the table below:

| **Principle**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spoofing               | This principle requires you to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another.<br><br>Access keys (such as API keys) or signatures via encryption helps remediate this threat. |
| Tampering              | By providing anti-tampering measures to a system or application, you help provide integrity to the data. Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate.<br><br>For example, shops use seals on food products.                                      |
| Repudiation            | This principle dictates the use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Information Disclosure | Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner.                                                                                                        |
| Denial of Service      | Applications and services use up system resources, these two things should have measures in place so that abuse of the application/service won't result in bringing the whole system down.                                                                    |
| Elevation of Privilege | This is the worst-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level i.e. an administrator. This scenario often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure.    |
> A breach of security is known as an incident. And despite all rigorous threat models and secure system designs, incidents do happen. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity.

Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.

An incident is responded to by a **Computer Security Incident Response Team** which is prearranged group of employees with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident. To successfully solve an incident, these steps are often referred to as the six phases of Incident Response that takes place, listed in the table below:

| Action          | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preparation     | Do we have resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?                                                                 |
| Identification  | Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?                                                |
| Containment     | Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?                                        |
| Eradication     | Remove the active threat.                                                                                                                   |
| Recovery        | Perform a full review of the impacted system to return to business as usual operations.                                                     |
| Lessons Learned | What can be learnt from the incident? I.e. if it was due to a Phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails. |
