# Authentication Vulnerabilities

Conceptually, authentication vulnerabilities are easy to understand. However, they are usually critical becasue of the clear relationship between authentication and security. 

Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further exploits. For this reason, it's important to learn how to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities, and how to bypass common protection measures.

In this section, we explain:

- The most common authentication mechanisms used by websites
- Potential vulnerabilities in these mechanisms
- Inherent vulnerabilities in different authentication mechanisms
- Typical vulnerabilities that are introduced by their improper implementation
- How you can make your own authentication mechanisms as robust as possible.

## Labs

If you're familiar with the basic concepts behind authentication vulnerabilities and want to practice exploiting them on some realistic, deliberately vulnerable targets, you can access labs in this topic from the link below.
