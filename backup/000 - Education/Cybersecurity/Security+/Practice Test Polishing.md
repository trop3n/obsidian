Correct Answer: **Stakeholder management plan**

Context:

- **Stakeholder management plan**: Understand who the stakeholders are, and their roles and goals in the incident management process. This plan is necessary to ensure that the IR plans meet the needs of the business.
- **Communication plan**: Know how to reach all key stakeholders (IR team, management, etc.), including backups if the main communication lines are down.
- **Disaster recovery plan**: Strategy for restoring the organization to normal operations after an incident.
- **Business continuity plan**: Stategy for maintaining operations and an incident is occuring, including failover plans and an analysis of potential risks and how to manage them. A *continuity of operations plan* (COOP) is related to this and ensures that an organization can maintain all critical functions during an incident.
