### Way of Thinking

> Instead of trying to learn all programming languages, we can focus on one, which will allow us to learn others more easily. 

R.D. Tennant initially defined all programming languages having 3 principles:

1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

> In information security, we have to learn and understand these principle, structures and processes quickly. 
> We will have many situations where we do not understand how "It" works. This is good. At this point, we have to find out what we do not know.

**When is a penetration tester good enough?**

One person cannot know everything. In this case, we have to learn how to `find, choose` and `adapt` the information we need. 

### Think Outside the Box

> The hackers way of thinking is called:

`Outside the Box` 

> We must understand the way of thinking that we currently use. Make it clearer. Try to understand what we have to work on.

### Occam's Razor

> One of the central principles of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:

`The most straighforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`

**Occam's Razor in Practice**

> We must also distinguish between the individual details and mechanisms and the general picture or concept. 
> It is crucial to understand the overall concept rather than the individual steps involved. 

`The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.`

> Once we understand the overall picture, adapting to the given situations and conditions is much easier. 

Suppose we have only learned the individual steps. In that case, we will have difficulty adapting them to new situations because we do not understand their impact on the systems and their applications.

### Talent

> Talent itself is not innate -- the ability to solve particular problems with excellence results from thought processes developed primarily in early childhood. 
> 	Children do not typically overcomplicate things like adults do.

> There is a tendency to believe that masters of their craft are born that way. 
> This is a misconception that comes from the interpretive ability of humans that we all must abstract from.

Talent, or the ability to solve specific problems and challenges with high efficiency, arise from the `constant or persistent` confrontation with the corresponding situations and the problems that arise. 

-  The confrontation expands the so-called comfort zone and repertoire, which allows us to think more easily and tackle the challenge or problem.
- In essence, talent is a trained and adapted thought process and the associated thought patterns for specific fields and situations.

### Way of Learning

> This "art of thinking", called `Outside the Box` is an essential part of the hacker mindset, or the way we must think as penetration testers to solve complex problems. 
> Thinking outside the box means seeing things outside of the limitations placed on us. 
> We must be able to "pivot"

`A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.`

If we feel good and know we will reach our goal, we will be successful.

### Learning Efficiency

> We have to understand how things work, how they are structured, and how to use them.
> All of the technical information we need to be successful is already out there. 

It is often not easy to find the information we need. First, we have to find out what kind of information we need. 

-  `What do we already know?`
-  `What do we not know yet?`

> We have to fail. It is an **unavoidable and essential part of learning.**

> Experience is built on failures.

**What does it mean to be good at something?**

> To be good at something means we know `what we are doing.` 
> If we know what we are doing, that measn that we are `experienced` with this topic. 
> Experience means we have a vast `repertoire` in this field.
> Repertoire comes from `associations` and `practial experience.` 

> The `Pareto Principle` states that with 20% of the effort, we can achieve 80% of the effect. 

### Learning Types

**Passive Learning**
> If we follow the learning pyramid while going through the modules just by reading, we will learn only about 10% of the whole penetration testing experience. 

**Active Learning**
> Information has a certain level of `quality`, but not all information is helpful. More than that, some information can confuse and disorient us completely. To learn to discern such information, we need a `repertoire` which we collect `by practicing.` 

**Efficiency depends not only on the quality of information we find but on the usage of that information.**
> Moreover, it depends on our `motivation, focus` and `our goal.` 

##### `Progress is not noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.`

#### The Brain

> We need to familiarize ourselves with our brain and get to know some of its components to understand the role of the upcoming sections better, how they are structured, and how they can influence our learning process.

**The Theory of Thought**

> `A thought is an individual process (action/reaction) to one or more influences (internal/external) in which information is interpreted and linked inwardly according to our personal methodology (developed through our existing lifetime)`

**Conscious Thoughts**

The following definition is sufficient for the description of human conciousness:

`Consciousness describes the totality of all those mental processes by which we become aware of the external and our internal world with active observation. Therefore, when we actively observe that we are looing at a monitor full of text and can decide to change the situation if necessary and intentionally look elsewhere, we are in conciousness.`

**Unconscious Thoughts**

> Thoughts in our unconscious, we do not perceive superficially. What we do perceive are emotions. 
> Emotions reflect the way we think subconsciously. We process far more thoughts subconsciously than consciously. 

### The Will

> A descriptive construct that presupposes a conscious decision to act, and thus, it is primarily associated with rational action.

> From a philosophical point of view, will is defined as deciding on a particular type of action based on the motives for acting consciously. So let us say will is the effort to perform a certain action or achieve a specific goal. Therefore, it is most relevant for us to have decided to achieve a goal that we have determined and strive for it.

`These people overlook the essential component that the path plays absolutely no role in how we reach that goal because, ultimately, our path is only created by the steps we take.` 

**Desire is very dependent on the belief in it.**

`Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.`

#### The Goal

> The results of a meta-analysis of over 200 studies with more than 40,000 participants show that over 90 percent of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by setting `challenging and specific goals.`

> As we can certainly already think and imagine, we will take different "paths" depending on the goal we have set for ourselves. There is even a big difference between passing an exam or just getting the certification for it. Many think that the certification proves that the trained skills have been acquired. However, for most, **the certification is a formal and official acknowledgment of participation in particular training.** For example, if we only want to get the certification or even just the confirmation of having completed something, we will look for the easiest way to get closer to that goal as quickly as possible. Decisions are made to ask someone how certain tasks are solved in order not to have to think about it.

#### Decision Making

> Research in decision psychology has established that people by no means behave exclusively in terms of cost-benefit considerations.

If we do not know what to do in one situation or another, the reason is usually that we have not gathered enough facts to make a good decision. However, once we have gathered enough data, we can better calculate what result we will achieve in the end, and based on the facts we have gathered, we open up possibilities and paths we can take.

### Documentation

> Determine the report audience
> We document activities differently than we would present our results to a customer

The essential characteristics of documentation are:
	1. Overview
	2. Structure
	3. Clarity

No matter who the documentation is intended for, here are some guidelines we can follow:

1. It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation
2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity
3. Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

### Organization

> Being organized in penetration testing because the entire report writing process has to be structured. 

It may take us a single day to take over several systems. So we don't want to keep looking four sources or information we need over and over again. Organization is best described in the following example:

There are many different management techniques and methods we can use:

-  Agile
-  Scrum
-  ToDo-Lists
-  Bullet Journal and more

### Focus

> When we focus on a topic, we concentrate most of our thinking and attention on the chosen topic. In doing so, all other thoughts concerning other topics will be completely faded out.

It is essential to differentiate between `focus` and `attention` because they are not the same. 

`Attention` refers to the **momentum**, as it is happening right now, and you are reading this text.

However, the `focus` is on the topic you are dealing with at the moment.

The focus is based on our will and what we want to achieve. It can be a `conscious decision` and a `subconscious decision` guided by external influences.

`Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.`

### Attention

> Our attention changes with out experience and the information we gain from the content and its clarity. 

`Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, goals and experiences.`

We have already approached this module with a confident attitude, expectation, orientation, and goal. Attention is an independent `mental process` that takes place subconsciously. 

### Comfort

> `Comfort` is an `emotional state` of a person's mind, which, among other aspects, has a strong influence on behavior, thinking, focus, attention, and the ability to concentrate. This is the feeling of well being in the form of comfort and the attitude of risk-free behavior.

The `Yerkes-Dodson` law, which describes the cognitive performance as a function of the level of stress/nervousness. 

When we leave the so-called `comfort zone`, we enter a situation or field where we have little or no experience. This kind of uncertainty lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought processes, which in turn, slows us down.

> The fact that children do not exhibit such uncertainty is interesting.
> `they love to try out something new all the time and are not afraid or uncertain of making mistakes.`

### Obstacles

**`Fear`**

We need to distinguish between fear in dangerous situations and interpreted fear of the learning process.

> Fear in dangerous situations is necessary and serves to protect one's own life or those of loved ones. 

> However, interpreted fear belongs to an imaginary state of fear. 

##### `People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present.`

Imaginary fear is an emotional state that keeps us from having the best experiences and prevents us from moving forward on the desired path. Even if we want to be excellent penetration testers, more beginners are afraid to put their maximum energy into it because of the imaginary fear of failure.

##### `The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often that the loser.`

### Mindset

> The mindset consists of thought processes we unconsciously acquire to avoid difficult situations or efforts. Such thought processes are also formed during our upbringing. For example, a child constantly criticized for the successes and failures will find it challenging to dare try something new. 
	-  A lack of criticism makes the child overconfident, which can lead to a misjudgment of their abilities. 

##### `All obstacles and feelings that prevent us from doing so are temporary. These feelings pass, but the goal remains.`

### Pressure

> Pressure can be described as mental stress, the totality of all detectable external and internal influences. Psychological pressures affect people based on a situation.
> They make demands on their resources. 

Perfectionism awakens in us the desire to do everything flawlessly, perfectly and above all, quickly.

### Questioning

> Learning to ask the right questions is an art and a critical skill. 

Questions represent the view of the situation before we take the next step and move on our way. Metaphorically speaking, we use them to see where we want to be or can take our next step.

##### `The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.`

The state we give to the questions does not affect the answers. The state attributed to the question belongs to the answer or the result.

> We can all ask questions. However, not many know how to ask the right questions. Because some significant differences and influences can greatly affect the answers we want to receive.

### Handling Frustration

> Frustration is an emotional reaction to an event, situation or condition that occurs in the form of disappointment or powerlessness. 

There are two different types of frustration:
-  `External Influences`
-  `Inner Frustration`

> Most people are not aware that feelings `reflect subconscious thoughts` and thought processes. 

That is why we can understand quite well how we think from our feelings.

 Everyone has an individual frustration tolerance, which is why people with a low frustration tolerance tend to give up or break off quickly when unexpected resistance arises, or the expected success does not occur within a specific time.
	 -  The result of this behavior is an increased tendency to stress and avoidance and partly aggressive forms of reaction.

##### `Enumeration is key` in information security.

> Since we are dealing with the offensive aspects of information security, it is essential that wee can get the information by ourselves.
> We will have to deal with different services, sources and technologies to find out how to get the information we need. The feeling of frustration with a lack of resources depends on our skill. 

> If we do not have the necessary skills, we will feel anxiety, which brings us back to the topic of comfort and comfort zone.

`To express our frustration tolerance adequately, we need to consciously but in a controlled way, place ourselves in situations where a particular frustration must be assumed.`

> It must be our conscious decision to deal with the upcoming situation.

### Learning Progress

> In order to see our progress, two specific states are compared, including a specific time window between the learning process. In other words, we compare our knowledge from the past with the present and try to keep track of the progress to give ourselves the confirmation that we achieved something new.

`We only gain height by going uphill. Going uphill is always exhausting, and we may slip and slide a little bit down again. What is essential here is to keep moving constantly`

**Whether we take one step a day or ten steps a day only plays a role in the duration.**

```
(1.00)365 = 1.00  
(1.01)365 = 37.7
```
> This is the difference that is made by only improving even just 1% a day.
