# Incident Handling

## Incident Handling Definition & Scope

Incident Handling (IH) has become an important part of an organization's defensive capability against cybercrime. While protective measures are constantly being implemented to prevent or lower the amount of security incidents, an incident handling capability is undeniably a necessity for any organization that cannot afford a compromise of its data confidentiality, integrity or availability. 

Some organizations choose to implement this capability in-house, while others rely on third-party providers to support them, continuously or when needed. Before we dive into the world of security incidents, let's define some terms and establish a common understanding of them.

An `event` is an action occurring in a system or network. Examples of events are:

- A user sending an email
- A mouse click
- A firewall allowing a connection request

An `incident` is an event with negative consequences. One example of an incident is s **system crash**. Another example is **unauthorized access to sensitive data**. Incidents can occur due to natural disasters, power failures, etc.

There is no single definition for what an IT security incident is, and therefore it varies between organizations. We define an IT security incident as an event with a clear intent to cause harm that is performed against a computer system. Examples of incidents are:

- Data Theft
- Funds theft
- Unauthorized access to data
- Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools

`Incident Handling is a clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment`.

It is important to note that incident handling is not limited to intrusion incidents alone. 

Other types of incidents, such as those caused by malicious insiders, availability issues, and loss of intellectual property, also fall within the scope of incident handling. A comprehensive incident handling plan should address various types of incidents and provide appropriate measures to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from them to restore normal business operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Bear in mind that it may not be immediately clear that an event is an incident, until an initial investigation is performed. With that being said, there are some suspicious events that should be treated as incidents unless proven otherwise. 
## Incident Handling's Value & Generic Notes

IT security incidents *frequently involve the compromise of personal and business data*, and it is therefore crucial to respond quickly and effectively. In some incidents, the impact may be limited to a few devices, while in others a large part of the environment can be compromised. A great benefit of having an incident handling team (often referred to as an incident response team) handle events is that a trained workforce will respond systematically, and therefore **appropriate actions will be taken**. 

In fact, the objective of such teams is to minimize the theft of information or the disruption of services that the incident is causing. This is achieved by performing investigations and remediation steps, which we will discuss more in depth shortly. Overall, the decisions that are taken before, during and after an incident will affect its impact.

Because different incidents will have different impacts on the organization, we need to understand the importance of **prioritization**. Incidents with greater severity will require immediate attention and resources to be allocated for them, while others rated lower may also require an initial investigation to understand whether it is in fact an IT security incident that we are dealing with.

The incident handling team is lead by an incident manager. This role is often assigned to a **SOC Manager**, **CISO/CIO**, or third-party (trusted) vendor, and this person usually has the ability to direct other business units as well. The incident manager must be able to obtain information or have the mandate to require an employee in the organization to perform an activity in a timely manner, if necessary. The incident manager is the *single point of communication* who tracks the activities taken during the investigation and their status of completion.

One of the most widely used resources on incident handling is [NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf). The document aims to assist organizations in mitigating the risks from computer security incidents by providing practical guidelines on responding to incidents effectively and efficiently. 
# Cyber Kill Chain

#cyberkillchain

## What is the Cyber Kill Chain?

Before we start talking about handling incidents, we need to understand the attack lifecycle (a.k.a. the cyber kill chain). This lifecycle describes how attacks manifest themselves. Understanding this lifecycle will *provide us with valuable insights on how far in the network an attacker is* and what they may have access to during the investigation phase of an incident. 

The cyber kill chain consists of seven different stages, as depicted in the image below:
### Recon

The `recon` stage is the initial stage, and it involves the part where an attacker *chooses their target*. Additionally, the attacker then performs information gathering to become more familiar with the target and gathers as much useful data as possible, which can be used in not only this stage but also in other stages of this chain. Some attackers prefer to perform passive information gathering from web sources such as LinkedIn and Instagram but also from documentation on the target organization's web pages. Job ads and company partners often reveal information about the technology utilized in the organization. They can provide extremely specific information about antivirus tools, operating systems, and networking technologies. Other attackers might go a step further, they start 'poking' and actively scan external web applications and IP addresses that belong to the target organization.
### Weaponize

In the `weaponize` stage, the malware to be used for initial access is developed and embedded into some type of exploit or deliverable payload. This malware is crafted to be extremely lightweight and undetectable by the antivirus and detection tools. It is likely that the attacker has gathered information to identify the present antivirus or EDR technology in the target organization. On a large scale, the sole purpose of this initial stage is *to provide remote access to a compromised machine in the target environment*, which also has the capability to persist through machine reboots and the ability to deploy additional tools and functionality on demand.
### Delivery

In the `delivery` stage, the exploit or payload is delivered to the victim(s). Traditional approaches are phishing emails that either contain a malicious attachment or a link to a web page. The web page can be twofold: either containing an exploit or hosting the malicious payload to avoid sending it through email scanning tools. In all fairness, the web page can also mimic a legit website used by the target organization in an attempt to trick the victim into entering their credentials and collect them. Some attackers *call the victim on the phone with a social engineering pretext* in an attempt to convince the victim to run the payload. The payload in these trust-gaining cases is hosted on an attacker controlled website that mimics a well-known web site to the victim (e.g. a copy of the target organization's website). It is extremely rare to deliver a payload that requires the victim to do more than double-click an executable file or a script (in Windows environments, this can be `.bat`, `cmd`, `.vbs`, `.js`, `.hta` and other formats). Finally, there are cases where physical interaction is utilized to deliver the payload via USB tokens and similar storage tools, that are purposely left behind.
### Exploitation

The `exploitation` stage is the moment when an exploit or a delivered payload is triggered. During the exploitation stage of the cyber kill chain, the attacker typically attempts to execute code on the target system in order to gain access or control. 
### Installation

In the `installation` phase, the initial stager is executed and is running on the compromised machine. As already discussed, the installation stage can be carried out in various ways, depending on the attacker's goals and the nature of the compromise. Some common techniques used in the installation stage include:

- **Droppers**: Attackers may use droppers to deliver malware onto the target system. A dropper is a small piece of code that is designed to install malware on the system and execute it. The dropper may be delivered through various means, such as email attachments, malicious websites, or social engineering tactics. 
- **Backdoors**: A backdoor is a type of malware that is designed to provide the attacker with ongoing access to the compromised system. The backdoor may be installed by the attacker during the exploitation stage or delivered through a dropper. Once installed, the backdoor can be used to execute further attacks or steal data from the compromised system. 
- **Rootkits**: A rootkit is a type of malware that is designed to hide its presence on a compromised system. Rootkits are often used in the installation stage to evade detection by antivirus software and other security tools. The rootkit may be installed by the attacker during the exploitation stage or delivered through a dropper.
### Command and Control

In the `command and control` stage, the attacker establishes a remote access capability to the compromised machine. As discussed, it is not uncommon to use a modular initial stager that loads additional scripts 'on-the-fly'. However, advanced groups will utilize separate tools in order to ensure that multiple variants of their malware live in a compromised network, and if one of them gets discovered and contained, they still have a means to return to the environment.
### Action/Objective

The final stage of the chain is the `action` or objective of the attack. The objective of each attack can vary. Some adversaries may go after exfiltrating confidential data, while others may want to obtain the highest level of access possible within a network to deploy ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that will render all data stored on an endpoint or endpoint devices and server unusable or inaccessable unless a ransom is paid within a limited timeframe (not recommended).

---

It is important to understand that adversaries won't operate in a linear manner (like the cyber kill chain shows). Some previous cyber kill chain stages will be repeated over and over again. If we take, for example, the `installation` stage of a successful compromise, the logical next step for an adversary going forward is to initiate the `recon` stage again to identify additional targets and find vulnerabilities to exploit, so that he moves deeper into the network and eventually achieves the attack's objective(s).

Our objective is to `stop an attacker from progressing further up the kill chain`, ideally in one of the earliest stages.
# Incident Handling Process Overview

Now that we are familiar with the cyber kill chain and it's stages, we can better predict/anticipate next steps in an attack and also suggest appropriate measures against them.

Just like the cyber kill chain, there are different stages, when responding to an incident, defined as the `incident handling process`. The `incident handling process` defines a capability for organizations to prepare, detect and respond to malicious events. Note that this process is suited for responding to IT security events, but its stages do not correspond to the stages of the cyber kill chain in a one-to-one manner. 

As defined by NIST, the incident handling process consists of the following four distinct stages:

![](https://i.imgur.com/jdcpneo.png)

Incident handlers spend most of their time in the first two stages, `preparation` and `detection & analysis`. This is where we spend a lot of time improving ourselves and looking for the next malicious event. When a malicious event is detected, we then move on to the next stage and respond to the event (`but there should always be resources operating on the first two stages, so that there is no disruption of preparation and detection capabilities`). As you can see in the image, the process is not linear but cyclic. The main point to understand at this point is that as new evidence is discovered, the next steps may change as well. It is vital to ensure that you don't skip steps in the process and that you complete a step before moving onto the next one. 

For example, if you discover ten infected machines, you should certainly not proceed with containing just five of them and starting eradication while the remaining five stay in an infected state. Such an approach can be ineffective because, at the bare minimum, you are notifying an attacker that you have discovered them and that you are hunting them down, which, as you could imagine, can have unpredictable consequences.

So, the incident handling process has two main activities, which are `investigating` and `recovering`. The investigation aims to:

- Discover the initial 'patient zero' victim and create an ongoing (if still active) incident timeline.
- Determine what tools and malware the adversary used
- Document the compromised systems and what the adversary has done

Following the investigation, the recovery activity involves creating and implementing a recovery plan. When the plan is implemented, the business should resume normal business operations, if the incident caused any disruptions.

When an incident is fully handled, a report is issued that details the cause and cost of the incident. Additionally, "lessons learned" activities are performed, among others, to understand what the organization should do to prevent incidents of similar type from incurring again. 

Let us now walk you through all stages of the `incident handling process`.
# Preparation Stage (Part 1)

In the `preparation stage`, we have two separate objectives. The first one is the establishment of incident handling capability within the organization. The second is the ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents by implementing appropriate protective measures. 

Such measures include endpoint and server hardening, active directory tiering, multi-factor authentication, privileged access management, and so on and so forth. While protecting against incidents is not the responsibility of the incident handling team, this activity is *fundamental to the overall success of that team*.
## Preparation Prerequisites

During the preparation, we need to ensure that we have:

- Skilled incident handling team members (incident handling team members can be outsourced, but a basic capability and understanding of incident handling are necessary in-house regardless).
- Trained workforce (as much as possible, through security awareness activities or other means of training)
- Clear policies and documentation
- Tools (software and hardware)
## Clear Policies and Documentation

> Some of the written policies and documentation should contain an up-to-date version of the following information:

- Contact information and roles of the incident handling team members
- Contact information for the legal and compliance department, management team, IT support, communications and media relations department, law enforcement, internet service providers, facility management, and external incident response team. 
- Incident response policy, plan and procedures
- Baselines of systems and networks, out of a golden image and clean state environment
- Network diagrams
- Organization-wide asset management database
- User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary (also to business-critical systems, which are handled with the skills needed to administer that specific system). These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during an initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users.
- Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process (urgent purchase of up to a certain amount). The last thing you need during an incident is to wait for weeks for the approval of $500 total.
- Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets

Some of the non-severe cases may be handled relatively quickly and without too much friction within the organization or outside of it. Other cases may require law enforcement notification and external communication to customers and third-party vendors, especially in cases of legal concerns arising from the incident. For example, a data breach involving customer data has to be reported to law enforcement within a certain time threshold in accordance with GDPR. There may be many compliance requirements depending on the location and/or branches where the incident has occurred, so the best way to understand these is to discuss them with your legal and compliance teams on a per-incident basis (or proactively).

While having documentation in place is vital, it is also important to **document the incident as you investigate**. Therefore, during this stage you will also have to establish an effective reporting capability. Incidents can be extremely stressful, and it becomes easy to forget this part as the incident unfolds itself, especially when you are focused and going extremely fast in order to solve it as soon as possible. Try to remain calm, take notes, and ensure that these notes contain timestamps, the activity performed, the result of it, and who did it. Overall, you should seek answers to who, what, when, where, why and how. 
## Tools (Software & Hardware)

Moving forward, we also need to ensure that we have the right tools to perform the job. These include, but are not limited to:

- Additional laptop or a forensic workstation for each incident handling team member to preserve disk images and log files, perform data analysis, and investigate without any restrictions (we know malware will be tested here, so tools such as antivirus should be disabled). These devices should be handled appropriately and not in a way that introduces risks to the organization.
- Digital forensic image acquisition and analysis tools
- Memory capture and analysis tools
- Live response capture and analysis
- Log analysis tools
- Network capture and analysis tools
- Network cables and switches
- Write blockers
- Hard drives for forensic imaging
- Power cables
- Screwdrivers, tweezers, and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble hardware devices if needed
- Indicator of compromise (IOC) creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
- Chain of custody forms
- Encryption software
- Ticket tracking system
- Secure facility for storage and investigation
- Incident handling system independent of your organization's infrastructure

Many of the tools mentioned above will be part of what is known as a `jump bag`, *always ready with the necessary tools to be picked up and leave immediately*. Without this prepared bag, gathering all necessary tools on the fly may take days or weeks before you are ready to respond.

Finally, we want to stress the importance of having your documentation system completely independent from your organization's infrastructure and properly secured. Assume from the beginning that your entire domain is compromised and that all systems can become unavailable. In similar fashion, communications about an incident should be conducted through channels that are not part of the organization's systems; assume that adversaries have control over everything and can read communication channels such as email.
# Preparation Stage (Part 2)

Another part of the `preparation` stage is to protect against incidents. While protection is not necessarily the responsibility of an incident handling team, any protection-related activities should be known to them to better understand the type and sophistication of an incident and know where to look for artifacts/evidence, that could aid the investigation. 

Let us now look at some of the highly recommended protective measures, which have a high mitigation impact against the majority of threats. 
## DMARC

[DMARC](https://dmarcly.com/blog/how-to-implement-dmarc-dkim-spf-to-stop-email-spoofing-phishing-the-definitive-guide#what-is-dmarc) is an email protection against phishing built on top of the already existing [SPF](https://dmarcly.com/blog/how-to-implement-dmarc-dkim-spf-to-stop-email-spoofing-phishing-the-definitive-guide#what-is-spf) and [DKIM](https://dmarcly.com/blog/how-to-implement-dmarc-dkim-spf-to-stop-email-spoofing-phishing-the-definitive-guide#what-is-dkim). The idea behind DMARC is to reject emails that 'pretend' to originate from your organization. Therefore, if an adversary is spoofing an email pretending to be an employee asking for an invoice to be paid, the system will reject the email before it reaches the intended recipient. DMARC is easy and inexpensive to implement, however, I cannot *stress enough that thorough testing is mandatory;* otherwise (and this is oftentimes the case), you risk blocking legitimate emails with no ability to recover them. 

With email filtering rules, you may be able to take DMARC to the 'next' level and apply additional protection against emails failing DMARC from domains you do not own. This is possible because some email systems will perform a DMARC check and include a header stating whether DMARC passed or failed in the message headers. While this can be incredibly powerful to detect phishing emails from any domain, it requires extensive testing before it can be introduced in a production environment. 

High false-positives here are emails that are sent 'on behalf of' via some email sending service, since they tend to fail DMARC due to domain mismatch.
## Endpoint Hardening & EDR

Endpoint devices (workstations, laptops) are the entry points for most of the attacks we are facing on a daily basis. If we consider the fact that most threats will originate from the internet and will target users who are browsing websites, opening attachments, or running malicious executables, a percentage of this activity will occur from their corporate endpoints.

There are a few widely recognized endpoint hardening standards by now, with CIS and Microsoft baselines being the most popular, and these should really be the building blocks for your organization's hardening baselines.

Some highly important actions (that usually work) to note and do something about are:

- Disable LLMNR/NetBIOS
- Implement LAPS and remove administrative privileges from regular users.
- Disable or configure PowerShell in "ConstrainedLanguag" Mode.
- Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules if using Microsoft Defender
- Implement Whitelisting. We know this is nearly impossible to implement. Consider at least blocking execution from user-writable folders (Downloads, Desktop, AppData, etc.). These are the locations where exploits and malicious payloads will initially find themselves. Remember to also block script types such as .hta, .vbs, .cmd, .bat, .js, and similar. Please pay attention to [LOLBin](https://lolbas-project.github.io) files while implementing whitelisting. Do not overlook them; they are really used in the wild as initial access to bypass whitelisting.
- Utilize host-based firewalls. As a bare minimum, block workstation-to-workstation communication and block outbound traffic to LOLBins.
- Deploy an EDR product. At this point in time, [AMSI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/how-amsi-helps) provides great visibility into obfuscated scripts for antimalware products to inspect the content before it gets executed. It is highly recommended that you only choose products that integrate with AMSI.

When it comes to hardening, `Don't let perfect be the enemy of good`.
## Network Protection

Network segmentation is a powerful technique to avoid having a breach spread across the entire organization. Business-critical systems must be isolated, and connections should be allowed only as the business requires. Internal resources should really not be facing the Internet directly (unless placed in a DMZ).

Additionally, when speaking of network protection you should consider IDS/IPS systems. Their power really shines when SSL/TLS interception is performed so that they can identify malicious traffic based on content on the wire and not based on reputation of IP addresses, which is a traditional and very inefficient way of detecting malicious traffic. 

Additionally, ensure that only organization-approved devices can get on the network. Solutions such as **802.1x** can be utilized to reduce the risk of bring your own device (BYOD) or malicious devices connecting to the corporate network. If you are a cloud-only company using, for example Azure/AzureAD, then you can achieve a similar protection with **Conditional Access** policies that will allow access to organization resources only if you are connecting from a company-managed device. 
## Privilege Identity Management / MFA / Passwords

At this point in time, stealing privileged user credentials is the **most common escalation path in Active Directory environments**. Additionally, a common mistake is that admin users either have a weak (but often complex) password or a shared password with their regular user account (which can be obtained via multiple attack vectors such as keylogging.) For reference, a weak but complex password is "Password1!"

It includes uppercase, lowercase, numerical and special characters, but despite this, it's easily predictable and can be found in many password lists that adversaries employ in their attacks. It is recommended to **teach employees to use pass phrases because they are harder to guess and difficult to brute force.**

An example of a password phrase that is easy to remember yet long and complex is "i LIK3 mt coffeE warm". If one knows a second language, they can mix up words from multiple languages for additional protection.
## Vulnerability Scanning

Perform continuous vulnerability scans of your environment and remediate at least the "high" and "critical" vulnerablities that are discovered. While the scanning can be automated, the fixes usually require manual involvement. If you can't apply patches for some reason, definitely segment the systems that are vulnerable!
## User Awareness Training

Training users to recognize suspicious behavior and report it when discovered is a big win for us. While it is unlikely to reach 100% success on this task, these trainings are known to significantly reduce the number of successful compromises. Periodic "surprise" testing should also be part of this training, including, for example, monthly phishing emails, dropped USB sticks in the office building, etc. 
## Active Directory Security Assessment

The best way to detect security misconfigurations or exposed critical vulnerabilities is by looking for them from the perspective of an attacker. Doing your own reviews (or hiring a third party if the skillset is missing from the organization) will ensure that when an endpoint device is compromised, the attacker will not have a one-step escalation possibility to high privileges on the network. The more additional tools and activity an attacker is generating, the higher the likelihood of you detecting them, so try to eliminate easy wins and low hanging fruits as much as possible. 

Active Directory has a few known and unique escalation paths/bugs. New ones are quite often discovered too. Active Directory security assessments are crucial for the security posture of the environment as a whole. Don't assume that your system administrators are aware of all discovered or published bugs, because in reality they probably aren't.
## Purple Team Exercises

We need to train incident handlers and keep them engaged. There is no question about that, and the best place to do it is inside an organization's own environment. Purple team exercises are essentially security assessments by a red team that either continuously or eventually inform the blue team about their actions, findings, any visibility/security shortcomings, etc. Such exercises will help in identifying vulnerabilities in an organization while testing the blue team's defensive capability in terms of logging, monitoring, detection and responsiveness. If a threat goes unnoticed, there is an opportunity to improve. For those that are detected, the blue team can test any playbooks and incident handling procedures to ensure they are robust and the expected result has been achieved.

# Detection and Analysis Stage (Part 1)

At this point, we have created processes and procedures, and we have guidelines on how to act upon security incidents. 

The `detection and analysis` phase involves all aspects of detecting an incident, such as utilizing sensors, logs and trained personnel. It also includes information and knowledge sharing, as well as utilizing context-based threat intelligence. Segmentation of the architecture and having a clear understanding of and visibility within the network are also important factors. 

Threats are introduced to the organization via an infinite number of attack vectors, and their detection can come from sources such as:

- An employee that notices abnormal behavior
- An alert from one of our tools (EDR, IDS, Firewall, SIEM, etc.)
- Threat hunting activities
- A third-party notification informing us that they discovered signs of our organization being compromised

It is highly recommended to create levels of detection by logically categorizing our network as follows:

- Detection at the network perimeter (using firewalls, internet-facing network intrusion detection/prevention systems, demilitarized zone, etc.)
- Detection at internal network level (using local firewalls, host intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc.)
- Detection at the endpoint level (using antivirus systems, endpoint detection & response systems, etc.)
- Detection at the application level (using application logs, service logs, etc.)
## Initial Investigation

When a security incident is detected, you should conduct some initial investigation and establish context before assembling the team and calling an organization-wide incident response. Think about how information is presented in the event of an administrative account connecting an IP address at HH:MM:SS. Without knowing what system is on that IP Address and which time zone the time refers to, we may easily jump to a wrong conclusion about what this event is about. To sum up, we should aim to collect as much information as possible at this stage about the following:

- Date/Time when the incident was reported. Additionally, who detected the incident and who reported it?
- How was the incident detected?
- What was the incident? Phishing? System Unavailability? etc.
- Assemble a list of impact systems (if relevant)
- Document who has access the impacted systems and what actions have been taken.
	- Make a note of whether this is an ongoing incident or the suspicious activity has been stopped
- Physical location, operating systems, IP addresses and hostnames, system owner, system's purpose, current state of the system
- (If malware is involved) List of IP addresses, time and date of detection, type of malware, systems impacted, export of malicious files with forensic information on them (hashes, copies of the files, etc.)

With the initially gathered information, we can start building an incident timeline. This timeline will keep us organized throughout the event and provide an overall picture of what happened. The events in the timeline are time-sorted based on when they occurred. Note that during the investigative process later on, we will not necessarily uncover evidence in this time sorted order. 

However, when we sort the evidence based on when it occurred, we will get context from the separate events that took place. The timeline can also shed some light on whether newly discovered evidence is part of the current incident. For example, imagine that what we though was the initial payload of an attack was later discovered to be present on another device two weeks ago. We will encounter situations where the data we are looking at is extremely relevant and situations where the data is unrelated and we are looking in the wrong place. Overall, the timeline should contain the information described in the following columns:

| `Date` | `Time of the event` | `hostname` | `event description` | `data source` |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
> Let's take one event and populate the example table from above. It will look as follows:

| `Date`     | `Time of the Event` | `hostname`  | `event description`                 | `data source`      |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 09/09/2021 | 13:31 CET           | SQLServer01 | Hacker tool 'Mimikatz' was detected | Antivirus Software |
As you can infer, the timeline focuses primarily on attacker behavior, so activities that are recorded depict when the attack occurred, when a network connection was established to access a system, when files were downloaded, etc. It is important to ensure that you capture from where the activity was detected/discovered and the systems associated with it.
## Incident Severity & Extent Questions

When handling a security incident, we should also try to answer the following questions to get an idea of the incident's severity and extent:

- What is the exploitation impact?
- What are the exploitation requirements?
- Can any business-critical systems be affected by the incident?
- Are there any suggested remediation steps?
- How many systems have been impacted?
- Is the exploit being used in the wild?
- Does the exploit have any worm-like capabilities?

The last two can possibly indicate the level of sophistication of an adversary.

As you can imagine, high impact incidents will be handled promptly, and incidents with a high number of impacted systems will have to be escalated.
## Incident Confidentiality & Communication

Incidents are very confidential and as such, all of the information gathered should be kept on a **need-to-know basis**, unless applicable laws or a management decision instruct us otherwise. There are multiple reasons for this.

1. The adversary may be, for example, an employee of the company
2. Or, if a breach has occurred, the communication of internal and external parties should be handled by the appropriate person in accordance with the legal department

When an investigation is launched, we will set some expectations and goals. These often include the type of incident that occurred, the sources of evidence that we have available, and a rough estimation of how much time the team needs for an investigation. 

Also, based on the incident, we will set expectations on whether we will be able to uncover the adversary or not. Of course, a lot of the above may change as the investigation evolves and new leads are discovered. It is important to keep everyone involved and the management informed about any advancements or expectations.
# Detection & Analysis (Part 2)

When an investigation is started, we waim to understand what and how it happened. To analyze the incident-related data properly and efficiently, the incident handling team members need **deep technical knowledge and experience in the field**. One may ask "Why do we care about how an incident happened? Why don't we simply rebuild the impacted systems and basically forget it ever happened?"

If we don't know how an incident happened or what was impacted, then any remediative steps we take will not ensure that the attacker cannot repeat his actions to regain access. If we, on the other hand, know exactly how the adversary got in, what tools they used, and which systems were impacted, then we can plan our remediation to ensure that this attack path cannot be replicated.
## The Investigation

The investigation starts based on the *initially gathered (and limited) information* that contains what we know about the incident so far. With this initial data, we will begin a 3-step cyclic process that will iterate over and over again as the investigation evolves. This process includes:

- Creation and usage of indicators of compromise (IoC)
- Identification of new leads and impacted systems
- Data collection and analysis from the new leads and impacted systems

![](https://i.imgur.com/dee9QTN.png)

> Let us now elaborate more on the process depicted above.
### Initial Investigation Data

In order to reach a conclusion, an investigation should be based on valid leads that have been discovered not only during this initial phase but throughout the entire investigation process. The incident handling team should bring up new leads constantly and not go solely after a specific finding, such as a known malicious tool. Narrowing an investigation down to a specific activity often results in limited findings, premature conclusions, and an incomplete understanding of the overall impact.
### Creation & Usage of IOCs

An indicator of compromise is a sign that an incident has occured. IOCs are documented in a structured manner, which represents the artifacts of the compromise. Examples of IOCs can be IP addresses, hash values of files, and file names.

In fact, because IOCs are so important to an investigation, special languages such as OpenIOC have been developed to document them and share them in a standard manner. Another widely used standard for IOCs is Yara. There are a number of free tools that can be utilized, such as Mandiant's IOC Editor, to create or edit IOCs. Using these languages, we can describe and use the artifacts that we uncover during an incident investigation. We may even obtain IOCs from third parties if the adversary or the attack is known.

To leverage IOCs, we will have to deploy and IOC-obtaining/IOC-searching tool (native or third part and possibly at scale). A common approach is to utilize WMI or PowerShell for IOC-related operations in Windows environments. A word of caution: during an investigation, we have to be extra careful to prevent the credentials of our highly privileged users from being cached when connecting to (potentially) compromised systems (or any systems really). More specifically, *we need to ensure that only connection protocols and tools that we don't cache credentials upon a successful login are utilized* (Such as WinRM). 

Windows logons with logon type 3 (Network Logon) typically don't cache credentials on the remote systems. The best example of "know your tools" that comes to mind is **PsExec**. When **PsExec** is used with explicit credentials, those credentials are cached on the remote machine. When "PsExec" is used without credentials through the session of the currently logged on user, the credentials are not cached on the remote machine. This is a great example of demonstrating how the same tool leaves different tracks, so be aware.
### Identification of New Leads & Impacted Systems

After searching for IOCs, you expect to have some hits that reveal other systems with the same signs of compromise. These hits may not be directly associated with the incident we are investigating. Our IOC could be, for example, too generic. We need to identify and eliminate **false positives**. We may also end up in a position where we come across a large number of hits. In this case, we should prioritize the ones we will focus on, ideally those that can provide us with new leads after a potential forensic analysis.
### Data Collection & Analysis From the New Leads & Impacted Systems

Once we have identified systems included in our IOCs, we will want to collect and preserve the state of those systems for further analysis in order to uncover new leads and/or answer investigative questions about the incident. Depending on the system, there are multiple approaches to how and what data to collect. Sometimes we want to perform a 'live response' on a system that is running, while in other cases we may want to shut down a system and then perform analysis on it.

Live response is the most common approach, where we collect a predefined set of data that is usually rich in artifacts that we may explain what happened to a system. Shutting down a system is not an easy decision when it comes to preserving valuable information because, in many cases, much of the artifacts will only live within the RAM of the machine, which will be lost if the machine is turned off. Regardless of the collection approach we choose, it is vital to ensure that minimal interaction with the system occurs to avoid any evidence or artifacts.

Once the data has been collected, it is time to analyze it. This is often the most *time-consuming process during an incident*. Malware analysis and disk forensics are the most common examination types. Any newly discovered and validated leads will be added to the timeline, which is constantly updated. Also note that memory forensics is a capability that is becoming more and more popular and is extremely relevant when dealing with advanced attacks. 

Keep in mind that during the data collection process, you should keep track of the **chain of custody** to ensure that the examined data is **court-admissable** if legal action is to be taken against the adversary.
# Containment, Eradication & Recovery Stage

When the investigation is complete and we have understood the type of incident and the impact on the business (based on all the leads gathered and the information assembled in the timeline), it is time to enter the containment stage to prevent the incident from causing more damage.
## Containment

 In this stage, we take action to prevent the spread of the incident. We divide the actions into `short-term containment` and `long-term containment`. It is important that containment actions are **coordinated** and **executed** across all systems **simultaneously**. Otherwise, we risk notifying attackers that we are after them, in which case they might change their techniques and tools in order to persist in the environment. 

In short-term containment, the actions taken leave a minimal footprint on the systems in which they occur. Some of these actions can include:

- Placing a system in a separate/isolated VLAN
- Pulling the network cable out of the system
- Modifying the attacker's C2 DNS name to system under our control or to a non-existing one

The actions here contain the damage and provide time to develop a more concrete remediation strategy.

Additionally, since we keep the systems unaltered (as much as possible), we have the opportunity to take forensic images and preserve evidence if this wasn't already done during the investigation (this is also known as the `backup` substage of the containment stage). If a short-term containment action requires shutting down a system, we have to ensure that this is communicated to the business and appropriate permissions are granted.

In long-term containment actions, we focus on persistent actions and changes. These can include:

- Changing user passwords
- Applying firewall rules
- Inserting a host IDS
- Applying a system patch
- Shutting down systems

While doing these activities, we should keep the business and the relevant stakeholders updated. Bear in mind that just because a system is now patched does not mean that the incident is over. 

Eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities are still pending. 
## Eradication

Once the incident is contained, eradication is necessary to eliminate both the root cause of the incident and what is left of it to ensure that the adversary is out of the systems and network. Some of the activities in this stage include removing the detected malware from systems, rebuilding some systems, and restoring others from backup. During the eradication stage, we may extend the previously performed containment activities by applying additional patches, which were not immediately required. Additional system-hardening activities are often performed during the eradication stage (not only on the impacted system but across the network in some cases).
## Recovery

In the recovery stage, we bring systems back to normal operation. Of course, the business needs to verify that a system is in fact working as expected and that it contains all the necessary data. When everything is verified, these systems are brought back into the production environment. All restored systems will be subject to heavy logging and monitoring after an incident, as compromised systems tend to be targets again if the adversary regains access to the environment in a short period of time. Typical suspicious events to monitor:

- Unusual logins (e.g. user or service accounts that have never logged in before)
- Unusual processes
- Changes to the registry in locations that are usually modified by malware

The recovery stage in some large incidents may take months, since it is often approached in phases. During the early phases, the focus is on increasing overall security to prevent future incidents through quick wins and the elimination of low-hanging fruits. The later phases focus on permanent, long-term changes to keep the organization as secure as possible.
# Post-Incident Activity Stage

In this stage, our objective is to document the incident and improve our capabilities based on lessons learned from it. This stage gives us an opportunity to reflect on the threat by understanding what occurred, what we did, and how our actions and activities worked out. This information is best gathered and analyzed in a meeting with all stakeholders that were involved during the incident. It generally takes place within a few days after the incident, when the incident report has been finalized.

## Reporting

The final report is a crucial part of the entire process. A complete report will contain answers to questions such as:

- What happened and when?
- Performance of the team dealing with the incident in regard to plans, playbooks, policies and procedures
- Did the business provide the necessary information and respond promptly to aid in handling the incident in an efficient manner? What can be improved?
- What actions have been implemented to contain and eradicate the incident?
- What preventative measures should be put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future?
- What tools and resources are needed to detect and analyze similar incidents in the future?

Such reports can eventually provide us with measurable results. For example, they can provide us with knowledge around how many incidents have been handled, how much time the team spends per incident, and the different actions that were performed during the handling process. Additionally, incident reports also provide *a reference for handling future events of a similar nature*. In situations where legal action is to be taken, an incident report will also be used in court and as a source for identifying the costs and impacts of incidents.

This stage is also a great place to train new team members by showing them how the incident was handled by more experienced colleagues. The team should also evaluate whether updating plans, playbooks, policies and procedures is necessary. During the post-incident activity state, it is important that we reevaluate the tools, training and resources and readiness of the team, as well as the overall team structure, and not focus only on the documentation and process front. 

We will explore the reporting part of the Incident Handling Process in more detail in the `Security Incident Reporting` module of the `SOC Analyst` job role path.
