# Windows Event Logs

## Windows Event Logging Basics

`Windows Event Logs` are an intrinsic part of the Windows Operating System, storing logs from different components of the system including the system itself, applications running on it, ETW providers, services, and others.

Windows event logging offers *comprehensive logging capabilities* for `application errors`, `security events`, and `diagnostic information`. As cybersecurity professionals, we leverage these logs extensively for analysis and intrusion detection. 

The logs are categorized into different event logs, such as "Application", "System", "Security", and others, to organize events based on their source or purpose. 

Event logs can be accessed using the `Event Viewer` application or programmatically using APIs such as the Windows Event Log API. 

Accessing the `Windows Event Viewer` as an administrative user allows us to explore the various logs available.

The default Windows Event Logs consist of `Application`, `Security`, `Setup`, `System`, and `Forwarded Events`. While the first four logs cover application errors, security events, system setup activities, and general system information, the "Forwarded Events" section is unique, showcasing event log data forwarded from other machines. This central logging feature proves valuable for sysadmins who desire a *consolidated view*. In our current analysis, we focus on event logs from a single machine.

It should be noted, that the Windows Even Viewer has the ability to open and display saved `.evtx` files, which can be then found in the "Saved Logs" section.

## The Anatomy of an Event Log

When examining `Application` logs, we encounter two distinct levels of events: `information` and `error`. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wXame0K.png)

Information events provide general usage details about the application, such as its start or stop events. Conversely, error events highlight specific errors and often offer detailed insights into the encountered issues. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ovNke1z.png)

Each entry in the Windows Event Log is an "Event" and contains the following primary components:

1. `Log Name`: The name of the event log (e.g. Application, System, Security, etc.)
2. `Source`: The software that logged the event.
3. `Event ID`: A unique identifier for the event.
4. `Task Category`: This often contains a value or name that can help us understand the purpose or use of the event.
5. `Level`: The severity of the event (Information, Warning, Error, Critical or Verbose)
6. `Keywords`: Keywords are flags that allow us to categorize events in ways beyond other classifications.
7. `User`: The user account that was logged on when the event occurred.
8. `OpCode`: This field can identify the specific operation that the event reports.
9. `Logged`: The date and time when the event was logged.
10. `Computer`: The name of the computer where the event occurred.
11. `XML Data`: All the above information is also included in an XML format along with additional event data.

The `keywords` field is particularly useful when filtering event logs for specific types of events. It can significantly enhance the precision of search queries by allowing us to specify events of interest, thus making log management more efficient and effective. 

Taking a closer look at the event log above, we observe several crucial elements. The `Event ID` in the top left corner serves as a unique identifier, which can be further researched on Microsoft's website to gather additional information. The "SideBySide" label next to the event ID represents the event source. Below, we find the general error description, often containing rich details. By clicking on the details, we can further analyze the event's impact using XML or a well-formatted view.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3mw16rE.png)

> Additionally, we can extract supplementary information from the event log, such as the process ID where the error occurred, enabling more precise analysis.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NiRPva2.png)

Switching our focus to security logs, let's consider event ID 3624, a commonly occurring event (detailed at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624)).

***Event ID 2634***: An account was successfully logged on.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3nZcNZG.png)

According to Microsoft's documentation, this event signifies the creation of a logon session on the destination machine, originating from the accessed computer where the session was established. Within this log, we find crucial details, including the "Logon ID", which allows us to correlate this logon with other events sharing the same "Logon ID". Another important detail is the "Logon Type", indicating the type of logon. In this case, it specifies a Service logon type, suggesting that "SYSTEM" initiated a new service. However, further investigation is required to determine the specific service involved, utilizing correlation techniques with additional data like the "Logon ID".
## Leveraging Custom XML Queries

To streamline our analysis, we can create custom XML queries to identify related events using the "Logon ID" as a starting point. By navigating to "Filter Current Log" -> "XML" -> "Edit Query Manually", we gain access to a custom XML query language that enables more *granular log searches*.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PKhVDs4.png)

In the example query, we focus on events containing the "SubjectLogonID", field with a value of "0x3E7". The selection of this value stems from the need to correlate events associated with a specific "Logon ID" and understand the relevant details within those events.

![](https://i.imgur.com/USh9VVK.png)

It is worth noting that if assistance is required in crafting the query, automatic filters can be enabled, allowing exploration of their impact on the XML representation. For further guidance, Microsoft offers informative articles on [advanced XML filtering in the Windows Event Viewer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/advanced-xml-filtering-in-the-windows-event-viewer/ba-p/399761).

By constructing such queries, we can narrow down our focus to the account responsible for initiating the service and eliminate unnecessary details. This approach helps unveil a clearer picture of recent logon activities associated with the specified Logon ID. However, even with this refinement, the amount of data remains significant. 

Delving into the log details progressively reveals a narrative. For instance, the analysis begins with [Event ID 4907](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4907), which signifies an **audit policy change.** 

![](https://i.imgur.com/KB8TdI1.png)

Within the [event description](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4907), we find valuable insights, such as "This event generates when the SACL of an object (for example, a registry key or file) was changed". 

In case unfamiliar with SACL, referring to the provided link ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists)) sheds light on access control lists (ACLs). The "S" in SACL denotes a system access control list, which enables administrators to log access attempts to secure objects. Each Access Control Entry (ACE) within a SACL specifies the types of access attempts by a designated trustee that trigger record generation in the security event log. ACEs in a SACL can generate audit records upon failed, successful, or both types of access attempts. For more information about SACLs, see [Audit Generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/audit-generation) and [SACL Access Right](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/sacl-access-right).

Based on this information, it becomes apparent that the permissions of a file were altered to modify the logging or auditing of access attempts. Further exploration of the event details reveals additional intriguing aspects. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/4RkTx8f.png)

For example, the process responsible for the change is identified as "SetupHost.exe", indicating a potential setup process (although it's worth noting that malware can *sometimes masquerade under legitimate names*). The object name impacted appears to be the "bootmanager", and we can examine the new and old security descriptors ("NewSd" and "OldSd") to identify the changes. Understanding the meaning of each field in the security descriptor can be accomplished through references such as the article [ACE Strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/ace-strings?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and [Understanding SDDL Syntax](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/msinf/other-help/understanding-sddl-syntax/).

From the observed events, we can infer that a setup process occurred, involving the creation of a new file and the initial configuration of security permissions for auditing purposes. Subsequently, we encounter the logon event, followed by a "special logon" event.

## ACE Strings

The [security descriptor definition language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language) (SDDL) uses ACE strings in the DACL and SACL components of a [_security descriptor_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly) string.

As shown in the [Security Descriptor String Format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format) examples, each ACE in a security descriptor string is enclosed in parentheses. The fields of the ACE are in the following order and are separated by semicolons (;)

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional [_access control entries_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly) (ACEs) have a different format than other ACE types. For conditional ACEs, see [Security Descriptor Definition Language for Conditional ACEs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language-for-conditional-aces-).

## Understanding SDDL Syntax

What follows is an appendix which pieces together several disparate Microsoft documents on the SDDL syntax. The SDDL syntax is important if you do coding of directory security or manually edit a security template file.
### Security Descriptor Definition Language

At the lowest level, the Security Descriptor Definition Language is used in the `nTSecurityDescriptor` attribute (and on registry keys and NTFS files) to define the ACL. Fortunately, one does not need to know this level of detail in normal conditions. But advanced administrators may want to write scripts or code that can correctly construct SDDL strings. Also the security templates (located in `%systemroot%\security\templates`) use SDDL if you manually edit them with a text editor instead of the MMC interface. I've found that manually editing these templates turns out to be the most effective way to manipulate them.
### Format of nTSecurityDescriptor string (bold and italics added for clarity):

O:owner_sidG:group_sidD:dacl_flags(string_ace1)(string_ace2)…(string_acen)S:sacl_flags(string_ace1)(string_ace2)…(string_acen)

Each nTSecurityDescriptor SDDL string is composed of 5 primary parts which correspond to the Header, DACL (D:), SACL (S:), primary group (G:)and owner (O:). Each of these parts is designated with the prefix noted in parenthesis. The header contains some record keeping information, along with 2 flags that designate whether the object is blocking inheritance for the SACL and DACL. The contents of both the primary group and owner parts are simply a single SID. The contents of both the SACL and DACL parts are a string with no fixed length. ACEs make up the contents of these strings. ACEs are enclosed within parenthesis, and there are 6 fields in each ACE. These 6 fields are separated by a semicolon delimiter. The fields are ACE type (allow/deny/audit), ACE flags (inheritance and audit settings), Permissions (list of incremental permissions), ObjectType (GUID), Inherited Object Type (GUID), and Trustee (SID).

Analyzing the special logon event, we gain insights into token permissions granted to the user upon a successful logon.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QHcOhTf.png)

A comprehensive list of privileges can be found in the documentation on [privilege constants](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants). For instace, the "SeDebugPrivilege" privilege indicates that the user possesses the ability to *tamper with memory that does not belong to them*.

Remember, one of the key aspects of threat detection is having a *good understanding of what is "normal"* in our environment. Anomalies that might indicate a threat in one environment could be normal behavior in another. It's crucial to tune our monitoring and alerting systems to our environment to minimize false positives and make real threats easier to spot. In addition, it's essential to have a centralized log management solution in place that can collect, parse, and alert on these events in real time. Regularly monitoring and reviewing these logs can help in early detection and mitigation of threats. Lastly, we need to make sure to correlate these logs with other systems and security logs to get a more holistic view of the security events in our environment. 
# Analyzing Evil with Sysmon & Event Logs

In our pursuit of robust cybersecurity, it is crucial to understand how to identify and analyze events effectively. Building upon our previous exploration of benign events, we will now delve into the realm of malicious activities and discover techniques for detection.

---
## Sysmon Basics

When investigating malicious events, several event IDs serve as common indicators of compromise. For instance, `Event ID 4624` provides insights into new logon events, enabling us to monitor and detect suspicious access and logon patterns. Similarly, `Event ID 4688` furnishes information about newly created processes, aiding the identification of unusual or malicious process launches. To enhance our event log coverage, we can extend the capabilities by incorporating Sysmon, which offers additional event logging capabilities. 

`System Monitor (Sysmon)` is a Windows system service and device driver that remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. Sysmon provides detailed information about process creation, network connections, changes to file creation time, and more.

Sysmon's primary components include:

- A Windows service for monitoring system activity.
- A device driver that assists in capturing the system activity data.
- An event log to display captured activity data. 

Sysmon's unique capability lies in its ability to log information that typically doesn't appear in the Security Event Logs, and this makes it a powerful tool for deep system monitoring and cybersecurity forensic analysis. 

Sysmon categorizes different types of system activity using event IDs, where each ID corresponds to a specific type of event. For example, `Event ID 1` corresponds to **Process Creation** events, and `Event ID 3` refers to **Network Connection Events**. The full list of Sysmon event IDs can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).

For more granular control over what events get logged, Sysmon used an XML based configuration file. The configuration file allows you to include or exclude certain types of events based on different attributes like process names, IP addresses, etc. We can refer to popular examples of useful sysmon configuration files:

- For a comprehensive configuration, we can visit:  [https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config). <-- `We will use this one in this section!`
- Another option is [https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular), which provides a modular approach.

To get started, you can install Sysmon by downloading it from the official Microsoft documentation ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)). Once downloaded, open an administrator command prompt and execute the following command to install Sysmon.

```shell
C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -i -accepteula -h md5,sha256,imphash -l -n
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/rVPZadd.png)

To utilize a custom Sysmon configuration, execute the following after installing Sysmon.

```
C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -c filename.xml
```

**Note**: It should be noted that [Sysmon for Linux](https://github.com/Sysinternals/SysmonForLinux) also exists.
## Detection Example 1: Detecting DLL Hijacking

In our specific use case, we aim to detect a DLL hijack. The Sysmon even log IDs relevant to DLL hijacks can be found in the Sysmon documentation ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)). To detect a DLL hijack, we need to focus on `Event Type 7`, which corresponds to **module load events**. To achieve this, we need to modify the `sysmonconfig-export.xml`. Sysmon configuration file we downloaded from [https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config).

By examining the modified configuration, we can observe that the "include" comment signifies events that should be included.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wh7CbW1.png)

In the case of detecting DLL hijacks, we change the "include" to "exclude" to ensure that nothing is excluded, allowing us to capture the necessary data.

![](https://i.imgur.com/KC5DpzS.png)

To utilize the updated Sysmon configuration, execute the following:

```
C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -c sysmonconfig-export.xml
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/o1tTR3e.png)

With the modified Sysmon configuration, we can start observing image load events. To view these events, navigate to the Event Viewer and access "Applications and Services" -> "Microsoft" -> "Sysmon". A quick check will reveal the presence of the targeted event ID.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ohrfkd3.png)

Let's see what a Sysmon event ID 7 looks like:

![](https://i.imgur.com/pedljvk.png)

The event log contains the DLL's **signing status** (in this case, it is Microsoft-signed), the process or image responsible for loading the DLL, and the specific DLL that was loaded. In our example, we observe that "MMC.exe" loaded "psapi.dll", which is also Microsoft signed. Both files are located in the System32 directory.

Now, let's proceed with building a detection mechanism. To gain more insights into DLL hijacks, conducting *research is paramount*. We stumble upon an informative [blog post](https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/hijacking-dlls-in-windows) that provides an exhaustive list of various DLL hijack techniques. For the purpose of our detection, we will focus on a specific hijack involving the vulnerable executable `calc.exe` and a list of DLLs that can be hijacked.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q7iSa6p.png)

Let's attempt the hijack using "calc.exe" and "WININET.dll" as an example. To simplify the process, we can utilize Stephen Fewer's "hello world" [reflective DLL](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/tree/master/bin). It should be noted that DLL hijacking does not require reflective DLLs.

By following the steps required, which involve renaming `reflective_dll.x64.dll` to `WININET.dll`, moving `calc.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32` along with `WININET.dll` to a writeable directory (such as the `Desktop` folder), and executing `calc.exe`, we achieve success. Instead of the Calculator application, a [MessageBox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messageboxa) is displayed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rZJzxgb.png)

Next, we analyze the impact of the hijack. First, we filter the event logs to focus on `Event ID 7`, which represents module load events, by clicking "Filter Current Log"...

![](https://i.imgur.com/nPW5GSH.png)

Subsequently, we search for instances of "calc.exe", by clicking "Find...", to identify the DLL load associated with our hijack.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YvKPHQW.png)

The output from Sysmon provides valuable insights. Now, we can observe several indicators of compromise (IoCs) to create effective detection rules. Before moving forward though, let's compare this to an authenticate load of "`wininet.dll"` by "`calc.exe`".

![](https://i.imgur.com/v8L6dLc.png)

> Let's explore these IoCs:

1. "`calc.exe`", originally located in System32, should not be found in a writable directory. Therefore, a copy of "`calc.exe`" in a writable directory serves as an IOC, as it should always reside in System32 or potentially Syswow64. 
2. :"`WININET.dll`", originally located in System32, should not be loaded outside of System32 by `calc.exe`. If instances of "`WININET.dll`" loading occur outside of System32 with "`calc.exe`" as the parent process, it indicates a **DLL Hijack** within `calc.exe`. While caution is necessary when alerting on all instances of "`WININET.dll`" loading outside of System32 (as some applications may package specific DLL versions for stability), in the case of "`calc.exe`", we can confidently assert a hijack due to the DLL's unchanging name, which attackers cannot modify to evade detection.
3. The original "`WININET.dll`" is a Microsoft-signed, while our injected DLL remains unsigned.

These three powerful IOCs provide an effective means of detecting a DLL hijack involving `calc.exe`. It's important to note that while Sysmon and event logs offer valuable telemetry for hunting and creating alert rules, they are not the sole sources of information.
## Detection Example 2: Detecting Unmanaged PowerShell/C-Sharp Injection

Before delving into detection techniques, let's gain a brief understanding of C# and its runtime environment. C# is considered a *managed* language, meaning it requires a **backend runtime** to execute it's code. The [Common Language Runtime (CLR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) serves as this runtime environment. [Managed code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code) does not directly run as assembly; instead, it is compiled into a bytecode format that the runtime processes and executes. Consequently, a managed process relies on the CLR to execute C# Code. 

As defenders, we can leverage this knowledge to detect unusual C# injections or executions without our environment. To accomplish this, we can utilize a useful utility called [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/).
### What is "managed code"?

When working with .NET, you'll often encounter the term "managed code". This article explains what *managed code* means and provides additional information around it. 

To put it simply, managed code is just that: code whose execution is *managed by a runtime*. In this case, the runtime in question is called the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**, regardless of the implementation (for example, [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/), .NET Framework, or .NET Core/.NET 5+). The CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code and then executing it. On top of that, the runtime provides several important services such as automatic memory management, security boundaries, and type safety.

Contrast this to the way you would run a C/C++ program, also called "unmanaged code". In the unmanaged world, the programmer is in charge of pretty much everything. The actual program is, essentially, a binary that the operating system (OS) loads into memory and starts. Everything else, from memory management to security considerations are a burden of the programmer. 

Managed code is written in one of the high-level languages that can be run on top of .NET, such as C#, Visual Basic, F# and others. When you compile code written in those languages with their respective compiler, you don't get machine code. You get **Intermediate Language** code which the runtime then compiles and executes. C++ is the one exception to this rule, as it can also produce native, unmanaged binaries that run on Windows.
### Common Language Runtime (CLR) Overview

.NET provides a run-time environment called the ***common language runtime*** that runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier. 

Compilers and tools expose the common language runtime's functionality and enable you to write code that benefits from the managed execution environment. Code that you develop with a language compiler that targets the runtime is called **managed code**. Managed code benefits from features such as cross-language integration, cross-language exception handling, enhanced security, versioning and deployment support, a simplified model for component interaction, and debugging and profiling services.

> [!NOTE]
> Compilers and tools produce output that the common language runtime can consume because the type system, the format of metadata, and the run-time environment (the virtual execution system) are all defined by a public standard.

By using Process Hacker, we can observe a range of processes within our environment. Sorting the processes by name, we can identify interesting color-coded distinctions. Notably, "powershell.exe", a managed process, is highlighted in green compared to other processes. Hovering over powershell.exe reveals the label "Process is managed (.NET)," confirming its managed status.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xlUaKxL.png)

Examining the module loads for `powershell.exe`, by right clicking on `powershell.exe`, clicking "Properties", and navigating to "Modules", we can find relevant information.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BCQ09kT.png)

The presence of "Microsoft .NET Runtime...", `clr.dll`, and `clrjit.dll` should attract our attention. These 2 DLLs are used when C# code is ran as part of the runtime to execute the bytecode. If we observe these DLLs loaded in processes that typically do not require them, it suggests a potential [execute-assembly](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) or [unmanaged PowerShell injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tvfb9poTKg&ab_channel=RaphaelMudge) attack.

To showcase unmanaged PowerShell injection, we can inject an [unmanaged PowerShell-like DLL](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell) into a random process, such as `spoolsv.exe`. We can do that by utilizing the [PSInject project](https://github.com/EmpireProject/PSInject) in the following manner.

```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
Import-Module .\Invoke-PSInject.ps1
Invoke-PSInject -ProcId [Process ID of spoolsv.exe] -PoshCode
"V3JpdGUtSG9zdCAiSGVsbG8sIEd1cnU5OSEi"
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/MNx4Oui.png)

After the injection, we observe that "spoolsv.exe" transitions from an unmanaged to a managed state.

![](https://i.imgur.com/M7MI4wP.png)

Additionally, be referring to both the related "Modules" tab of Process Hacker and Sysmon `Event ID 7`, we can examine the DLL load information to validate the presence of the aforementioned DLLs.

## Detection Example 3: Detecting Credential Dumping

Another critical aspect of cybersecurity is detecting dumping activities. One widely used tool for credential dumping is [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), offering various methods for extracting Windows credentials. One specific command "`sekurlsa::logonpasswords`", enables the dumping of password hashes or plaintext passwords by accessing the [Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service). LSASS is responsible for managing user credentials and is a primary target for credential dumping tools like Mimikatz.

The attack can be executed as follows:

```cmd-session
C:\Tools\Mimikatz> mimikatz.exe

  .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 (x64) #18362 Feb 29 2020 11:13:36

        ssp :   KO
        credman :
```

As we can see, the output of the `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` command provides powerful insights into compromised credentials. 

To detect this activity, we can rely on a different Sysmon event. Instead of focusing on DLL loads, we shift our attention to process access events. By checking `Sysmon even ID 10`, which represents "ProcessAccess" events, we can identify any suspicious attempts to access LSASS. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/kfKDhcZ.png)

For instance, if we observe a random file ("AgentEXE" in this case) from a random folder ("Downloads" in this case) attempting to access LSASS, it indicates unusual behavior. Additionally, the `SourceUser` being different from the `TargetUser` e.g. "waldo" as the `SourceUser` and "SYSTEM" as the `TargetUser`) further emphasizes the abnormality. It's also worth noting that as part of the mimikatz-based credential dumping process, the user must request [SeDebugPrivileges](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080314-00/?p=23113). As the name suggests, it's primarily used for debugging. This can be another Indicator of Compromise (IOC).

Please note that some legitimate processes may access LSASS, such as authentication-related processes or security tools like AV or EDR.
# Event Tracing for Windows

In the realm of effective threat detection and incident response, we often find ourselves relying on the limited dog data at our disposal. However, this approach falls short of fully harnessing the immense wealth of information that can be derived from the powerful resource known as `Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)`. Unfortunately, this oversight can be attributed to a lack of awareness and appreciation for the comprehensive and intricate insights that ETW can offer.

---
## What is ETW?

According to Microsoft, `Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)` is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers.

ETW, functioning as a high-performance event tracing mechanism deeply embedded within the Windows operating system, presents an unparalleled opportunity to bolster our defense capabilities. Its architecture facilitates the dynamic generation, collection, and analysis of various events occurring within the system,  resulting in the creation of intricate, real-time logs that encompass a wide spectrum of activities. 

By effectively leveraging ETW, we can tap into an expansive array of telemetry sources that surpass the limitations imposed by traditional log data. ETW captures a diverse set of events, spanning:

- system calls
- process creation
- process termination
- network activity
- file and registry modifications
- numerous other dimensions

These events collectively weave a detailed tapestry of system activity, furnishing invaluable context for the identification of anomalous behavior, discovery of potential security incidents, and facilitation of forensic investigations.

ETW's versatility and extensibility are further accentuated by its seamless integration with Event Providers. These specialized components generate specific types of events and can be seamlessly incorporated into:

- applications 
- operating system components
- third-party software

Consequently, this integration ensures a *broad coverage of potential event sources*. Furthermore, ETW's extensibility enables the creation of custom providers tailored to address specific organizational requirements, thereby fostering a targeted and focused approach to logging and monitoring.

Notably, ETW's lightweight nature and minimal performance impact render it an optimal telemetry solution for real-time monitoring and continuous security assessment. By selectively enabling and configuring relevant event providers, we can finely adjust the scope of data collection to align with our specific security objectives, striking a harmonious balance between the richness of information and system performance considerations.

Moveover, the existence of robust tooling and utilities, including Microsoft's Message Analyzer and Powershell's `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet, greatly simplifies the retrieval, parsing, and analysis of ETW logs. These tools offer advanced filtering capabilities, event correlation mechanisms, and real-time monitoring features, empowering members of the blue team to extract actionable insights from the vast pool of information captured by ETW.

## ETW Architecture & Components

The underlying architecture and the key components of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) are illustrated in the following diagram from [Microsoft](https://web.archive.org/web/20200725154736/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ntdebugging/part-1-etw-introduction-and-overview).

![](https://i.imgur.com/nztTzos.png)

- `Controllers`: The Controllers component, as its name implies, assumes control over all aspects related to ETW operations. It encompasses functionalities such as initiating and terminating trace sessions, as well as enabling or disabling providers within a particular trace. Trace sessions can establish subscriptions to one or multiple providers, thereby granting the providers the ability to commence logging operations. An example of a widely used control is the built-in utility "logman.exe", which facilitates the management of ETW activities. 

At the core of ETW's architecture is the **publish-subscribe model**. This model involves two primary components:

- `Providers`: Providers play a pivotal role in generating events and writing them to the designated ETW sessions. Applications have the ability to register ETW providers, enabling them to generate and transmit numerous events. There are four distinct types of providers utilized within ETW.
	- `MOF Providers`: These providers are based on the **Managed Object Format (MOF)** and are capable of generating events according to predefined MOF schemas. They offer a flexible approach to event generation and are widely used in various scenarios. 
	- `WPP Providers`: Standing for **Windows Software Trace Processor**, WPP providers leverage specialized macros and annotations within the application's source code to generate events. This type of provider is often utilized for low-level kernel-mode tracing and debugging purposes.
	- `Manifest-Based Providers`: Manifest-based providers represent a more contemporary form of providers within ETW. They rely on XML manifest files that define the structure and characteristics of events. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and ease of management, allowing for dynamic even generation and customization.
	- `TraceLogging Providers`: TraceLogging providers offer a simplified and efficient approach to event generation. They leverage the TraceLogging API, introduced in recent Windows versions, which streamlines the process of event generation with minimal code required. 
- `Consumers`: Consumers subscribe to specific events of interest and receive those events for further processing or analysis. By default, the events are typically directed to an .ETL (Event Trace Log) file for handling. However, an alternative consumer scenario involves leveraging the capabilities of the Windows API to process and consume the events. 
- `Channels`: To facilitate efficient event collection and consumption, ETW relies on event channels. Event channels act as logical containers for organizing and filtering events based on their characteristics and importance. ETW supports multiple channels, each with its own defined purpose and audience. Event consumers can selectively subscribe to specific channels to receive relevant events for their respective use cases.
- `ETL Files`: ETW provides specialized support for writing events to disk through the use of event trace log files, commonly referred to as "ETL files". These files serve as durable storage for events, enabling offline analysis, long-term archiving, and forensic investigations. ETW allows for seamless rotation and management of ETL files to ensure efficient storage utilization.
### Notes

- ETW supports even providers in both kernel mode and user mode.
- Some event providers generate a significant volume of events, which can potentially overwhelm the system resources if they are constantly active. As a result, to prevent unnecessary resource consumption, these providers are typically disabled by default and are only enabled when a tracing session specifically requests their activation.
- In addition to its inherent capabilities, ETW can be extended through *custom event providers*.
- [Only ETW provider events that have a Channel property applied to them can be consumed by the event log](https://medium.com/threat-hunters-forge/threat-hunting-with-etw-events-and-helk-part-1-installing-silketw-6eb74815e4a0)
## Interacting with ETW

`Logman` is a pre-installed utility for managing Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and Event Tracing Sessions. This tool is invaluable for creating, initiating, halting and investigating tracing sessions. This is particularly useful when determining which sessions are set for data collection when initiating your own data collection.

Employing the `-ets` parameter will allow for a direct investigation of the event tracing sessions, providing insights into system-wide tracing sessions. As an example, the Sysmon Event Tracing Sessions can be found towards the end of the displayed information.

```cmd
C:\Tools> logman.exe query -ets

When we examine an Event Tracing Sessions directly, we uncover specific session details including:

- Name
- Max Log Size
- Log Location
- Subscribed providers

This information is ***invaluable for incident responders***. Discovering a session that records providers relevant to your interests may provide crucial logs for an investigation.

Please note that the "-ets" parameter is vital to the command. Without it, Logman will not identify the Event Tracing Session.

For each provider subscribed to the session, we can acquire critical data:

- `Name / Provider GUID`: This is the exclusive identifier for the provider.
- `Level`: This describes the event level, indicating if it's filtering for warning, informational, critical, or all events. 
- `Keywords Any`: Keywords create a filter based on the kind of event generated by the provider.

Windows 10 includes more than 1,000 built-in providers. Moreover, Third-Party Software often incorporates its own ETW providers, especially those operating in Kernel mode.

Due to the high number of providers, it's usually advantageous to filter them using `findstr`. For instance, you will see multiple results for "`Winlogon`" in the given example. 

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers | findstr "Winlogon"
Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon               {DBE9B383-7CF3-4331-91CC-A3CB16A3B538}
Windows Winlogon Trace                   {D451642C-63A6-11D7-9720-00B0D03E0347}
```

By specifying a provider with Logman, we gain a deeper understanding of the provider's function. This will inform us about the Keywords we can filter on, the available event levels, and which processes are currently utilizing the provider.

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon

The `Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon/Diagnostic` and `Microsoft-Windows-WinLogon/Operational` keywords reference the event logs generated from this provider. 

GUI-based alternatives also exist. These are:

1. Using the graphical interface of the `Performance Monitor` tool, we can visualize various running trace sessions. A detailed overview of a specific trace can be accessed simply by double-clicking on it. This reveals all pertinent data related to the trace, from the engaged providers and their activated features to the nature of the trace itself. Additionally, these sessions can be modified to suit our needs by incorporating or eliminating providers. Lastly, we can device new sessions by opting for the "User Defined" category.

## Restricted Providers

In the realm of Windows operating system security, certain ETW providers are considered "restricted". These providers offer valuable telemetry but only accessible that carry the requisite permissions. This exclusivity is designed to ensure that sensitive system data remains shielded from potential threats.

One of these high-value, restricted providers is `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`. This provider offers crucial insights into potential security threats and is often leveraged in **Digital Forensics and Incident Response** (DFIR) operations. However, toa ccess this provider, processes must be privileged with specific right, know as Protected Process Light (PPL).

According to Elastic: *To be able to run as PPL, an anti-malware vendor must apply to Microsoft, prove their identity, sign binding legal documents, implement an Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) driver, run it through a test suite, and submit it to Microsoft for a special Authenticode signature. It is not a trivial process. Once this process is complete, the vendor can use this ELAM driver to have Windows protect their anti-malware service by running it as a PPL.*

With that said, [workarounds to access the `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` provider exist](https://posts.specterops.io/uncovering-windows-events-b4b9db7eac54).

In the context of `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`, the benefits of this privileged access are manifold. This provider can record highly granular data about potential threats, enabling security professionals to detect and analyze sophisticated attacks that may have eluded other defenses. Its telemetry can serve as vital evidence in forensic investigations, revealing details about the origin of a threat, the systems and data it interacted with, and the alterations it made. Moreover, by monitoring this provider in real-time, security teams can potentially identify ongoing threats and intervene to mitigate damage.

In the next section, we will utilize ETW to investigate attacks that may evade detection if we rely solely on Sysmon for monitoring and analysis, due to its inherent limitations in capturing certain events.

# Tapping into ETW
## Detection Example 1: Detecting Strange Parent-Child Relationships

Abnormal parent-child relationships among processes can be indicative of malicious activities. In standard Windows environments, certain processes never call or spawn others. For example it it highly unlikely to see "calc.exe" spawning "cmd.exe" in a normal Windows environment. 

Understanding these typical parent-child relationships can assist in detecting anomalies. Samir Boussaden has shared an insightful min map introducing common parent-child relationships, which can be referenced [here](https://twitter.com/SBousseaden/status/1195373669930983424).

By utilizing Process Hacker, we can explore parent-child relationships within Windows. Sorting the processes by dropdowns in the Processes view reveals a hierarchical representation of the relationships.

Analyzing these relationships in standard and custom environments enables us to identify deviations from normal patterns. For example, if we observe the "spoolsv.exe" process creating "whoami.exe" instead of its expected behavior of creating a "`conhost`", it raises suspicion.

To showcase a strange parent-child relationship, where "cmd.exe" appears to be created by "spoolsv.exe" `with no accompanying arguments`, we will utilize an attacking technique called **Parent PID Spoofing**. Parent PID spoofing can be executed through the [psgetsystem project](https://github.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem) in the following manner.

![](https://i.imgur.com/C1dw4Vt.jpeg)

Due to the parent PID spoofing technique we employed, Sysmon Event 1 incorrectly displays `spoolsv.exe` as the parent of `cmd.exe`. However, it was actually `powershell.exe` that created `cmd.exe`.

As we have previously discussed, although Sysmon and event logs provide valuable telemetry for hunting and creating alert rules, they are not the only sources of information. Let's begin by collecting data from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` provider using [SilkETW](https://github.com/mandiant/SilkETW) (the provider can be indentified using `logman` as we described previously, `logman.exe query providers | findstr "Process"`). After that, we can proceed to simulate the attack again to assess whether ETW can provide us with more accurate information regarding the execution of `cmd.exe`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GmXsHBp.jpeg)

```cmd-session
c:\Tools\SilkETW_SilkService_v8\v8\SilkETW>SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process -ot file -p C:\windows\temp\etw.json
```

the `etw.json` file (that includes data from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` provider) seems to contain information about `powershell.exe` being the one who created `cmd.exe`.

It should be noted that SilkETW event logs can be ingested and viewed by Windows Event Viewer through `SilkService` to provide us with deeper and more extensive visibility into the actions performed on a system.
## Detection Example 2: Detecting Malicious .NET Assembly Loading

Traditionally, adversaries employed a strategy known as ["Living off the Land" (LotL)](https://www.attackiq.com/2023/03/16/hiding-in-plain-sight/), exploiting legitimate tools, such as PowerShell, to carry out their malicious operations. This approach reduces the risk detection since it involves the use of tools that are native to the system, and therefore is less likely to raise suspicion.

However, the cybersecurity community has adapted and developed countermeasures against this strategy.

Responding to these defensive advancements, attackers have developed a new approach that Mandiant Labs labels as ["Bring Your Own Land" (BYOL)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/bring-your-own-land-novel-red-teaming-technique). Instead of relying on the tools already present on a victim's system, threat actors and penetration testers emulating these tactics now employ .NET assemblies executed entirely in memory. This involves creating custom-built tools using languages like C#, rendering them independent of the pre-existing tools on the target system. The "Bring Your Own Land" lands in quite effective for the following reasons:

- Each Windows system comes equipped with a certain version of .NET pre-installed by default. 
- A salient feature of .NET is its managed nature, alleviating the need for programmers to manually handle memory management. This attribute is part of the framework's managed code execution process, where the Common Language Runtime (CLR) takes responsibility for key system-level operations such as **garbage collection**, **eliminating memory leaks** and **ensuring more efficient resource utilization**.
- One of the intriguing advantages of using .NET assemblies is their ability to be loaded directly into memory. This means that an executable or DLL does **not** need to be written **physically to the disk** -- instead, it is executed directly in memory. This behavior minimizes the artifacts left behind on the system and can help bypass some forms of detection that rely on inspecting files written to disk. 
- Microsoft has integrated a wide range of libraries into the .NET framework to address numerous programming challenges. These libraries include functionalities include :
	- establishing HTTP connections
	- implementing cryptographic operations
	- enabling inter-process communication, such as named pipes
- These prebuilt tools streamline the development process, reduce the liklihood of errors, and make it easier to build robust and efficient applications. Furthermore, for  a threat actor, these rich features provide a toolkit for creating more sophisticated and covert attack methods.

A powerful illustration of this BYOL strategy is the ["execute-assembly"](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) command implemented in CobaltStrike, a widely-used software platform for Adversary SImulations and Red Team Operations. CobaltStrike's 'execute-assembly' command allows the user to execute .NET assemblies directly from memory, making it an ideal tool for implementing a BYOL strategy.

In a manner akin to how we detected the execution of unmanaged PowerShell scripts through the observation of anomalous `clr.dll` and `clrjit.dll` loading activity in processes that ordinarily wouldn't require them, we can employ a similar approach to identify malicious .NET assembly loading. This is achieved by scrutinizing the activity related to the loading of [.NET-associated DLLs](https://redhead0ntherun.medium.com/detecting-net-c-injection-execute-assembly-1894dbb04ff7), specifically `clr.dll` and `mscoree.dll`.

Monitoring the loading of such libraries can help reveal attempts to execute .NET assemblies in unusual or unexpected contexts, which can be a sign of malicious activity. This type of DLL loading behavior can often be detected by leveraging Sysmon's Event ID 7, which corresponds to "Image Loaded" events.

For demonstrative purposes, let's emulate a malicious .NET assembly load by executing a precompiled version of [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) that resides on disk. `Seatbelt` is a well-known .NET assembly, often employed by adversaries who load and execute it in memory to gain situational awareness on a compromised system.

```powershell

Assuming we have Sysmon configured appropriately to log image loading events (Event ID 7), executing 'Seatbelt.exe' would trigger the loading of key .NET-related DLLs such as '`clr.dll` and `mscoree.dll`'. Sysmon, keenly observing system activities, will log these DLL load operations as Event ID 7 records.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RcqDuSj.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/muSMVUy.png)

As already mentioned, relying solely on Sysmon Event ID 7 for detecting attacks can be challenging due to the large volume of events it generates (especially if not configured properly). Additionally, while it informs us about the DLLs being loaded, it doesn't provide granular details about the actual content of the loaded .NET assembly. 

To augment our visibility and gain deeper insights into the actual assembly being loaded, we can again leverage **Event Tracing** for Windows (ETW) and specifically the `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime` provider.

Let's use SilkETW to collect data from the `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime` provider. After that, we can proceed to simulate the attack again to evaluate whether ETW can furnish us with more detailed and actionable intelligence regarding the loading and execution of the 'Seatbelt' .NET Assembly. 

```cmd
c:\Tools\SilkETW_SilkService_v8\v8\SilkETW>SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime -uk 0x2038 -ot file -p C:\windows\temp\etw.json
```

The `etw.json` file (that includes data from the `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime` provider) seems to contain a wealth of information about the loaded assembly, including method names.

![](https://i.imgur.com/L1KAcTf.png)

It's worth noting that in our current SilkETW configuration, we're not capturing the entirety of events from the "Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime" provider. Instead, we're selectively targeting a specific subset (indicated by `0x2038`), which includes: `JitKeyword`, `InteropKeyword`, `LoaderKeyword`, and `NGenKeyword`.

- The `JitKeyword` relates to the Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation events, providing information on the methods being compiled at runtime. This could be particularly useful for understanding the execution flow of the .NET Assembly.
- The `InteropKeyword` refers to Interoperability events, which come into play when managed code interacts with unmanaged code. These events could provide insights into potential interactions with native APIs or other unmanaged components. 
- `LoaderKeyword` events provide details on the assembly loading process within the .NET runtime, which can be vital for understanding what .NET assemblies are being loaded and potentially executed. 
- Lastly, the `NGenKeyword` corresponds to Native Image Generator (NGen) events, which are concerned with the creation and usage of precompiled .NET assemblies. Monitoring these could help detect scenarios where attackers use precompiled .NET assemblies to evade JIT-related detections.

This [blog post](https://medium.com/threat-hunters-forge/threat-hunting-with-etw-events-and-helk-part-1-installing-silketw-6eb74815e4a0) provides valuable perspectives on SilkETW as well as the identification of malware based on .NET.

# Get-WinEvent

Understanding the important of mass analysis of Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs is *pivotal in the realm of cybersecurity*, especially in Incident Response (IR) and threat hunting scenarios. These logs hold invaluable information about the state of your systems, user activities, potential threats, system changes, and troubleshooting information. 

However, these logs can also be ***voluminous and unwieldy***. For large-scale organizations, it's not uncommon to generate millions of logs each day. Hence to distill useful information from these logs, we require efficient tools and techniques to analyze these log en masse. 

One of these tools is the [Get-WinEvent cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent?view=powershell-7.3) in PowerShell.
## Using Get-WinEvent

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet is an indispensable tool in PowerShell for querying Windows Event logs en masse. The cmdlet provides us with the capability to retrieve different types of event logs, including classic Windows event logs like System and Application logs, logs generated by Windows Event Log technology, and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logs. 

To quickly identify the available logs, we can leverage the `-ListLog` parameter in conjunction with the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet. By specifying `*` as the parameter value, we retrieve all logs without applying any filtering criteria. This allows us to obtain a comprehensive list of logs and their associated properties. By executing the following command, we can retrieve the list of logs and display essential properties such as:

- `LogName`
- `RecordCount`
- `IsClassicLog`
- `IsEnabled`
- `LogMode`
- `LogType`

The `|` character is a **pipe operator**. It is used to pass the output of one command (in this case, the `Get-WinEvent` command) to another command (in this case, the `Select-Object`) command.

PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | Select-Object LogName, RecordCount, IsClassicLog, IsEnabled, LogMode, LogType | Format-Table -AutoSize

This command provides us with valuable information about each log, including the name of the log, the number of records present, whether the log is in the classic `.evt` format or the newer `.evtx` format, its enabled status, the log mode (Circular, Retain, or AutoBackup), and the log type (Administrative, Analytical, Debug, or Operational).

Additionally, we can explore the event log providers associated with each log using the `-ListProvider` parameter. Event log providers serve as the sources of events within the logs. Executing the following command allows us to retrieve the list of providers and their respective linked logs.

This command provides us with an overview of the available providers and their associations with specific logs. It enables us to identify providers of interest for filtering purposes.

Now, let's focus on retrieving specific event logs using the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet. As its most basic, `Get-WinEvent` retrieves event logs from local or remote computers. The examples below demonstrate how to retrieve events from various logs. 

### 1. **Retrieving Events from System Logs**

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -LogName 'System' -MaxEvents 50 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

```

This example retrieves the first 50 events from the System Log. It selects specific properties, including the event's creation time, ID, provider name, level display name, and message. This facilitates easier analysis and troubleshooting.

### 2. Retrieving Events from Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational' -MaxEvents 30 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

TimeCreated            Id ProviderName            LevelDisplayName Message
-----------            -- ------------            ---------------- -------
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   132 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration completed successfully
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   145 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration started with resourceUri...
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   132 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration completed successfully
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   145 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration started with resourceUri...
6/2/2023 9:29:54 AM   209 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      The Winrm service started successfully
--- SNIP ---
```

In this example, events are retrieved from the Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational log. The command retrieves the first 30 events and selects relevant properties for display, including the event's 

- creation time
- ID
- provider name
- level display name
- message

To retrieve the oldest events, instead of manually sorting the results, we can utilize the `-Oldest` parameter with the Get-WinEvent cmdlet. This parameter allows us to retrieve the first events based on their chronological order. The following command demonstrates how to retrieve the oldest 30 events from the `Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational` log.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational' -MaxEvents 30 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

TimeCreated            Id ProviderName            LevelDisplayName Message
-----------            -- ------------            ---------------- -------
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   132 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration completed successfully
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   145 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration started with resourceUri...
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   132 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration completed successfully
6/2/2023 9:30:15 AM   145 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      WSMan operation Enumeration started with resourceUri...
6/2/2023 9:29:54 AM   209 Microsoft-Windows-WinRM Information      The Winrm service started successfully
--- SNIP ---
```
### 3. Retrieving Events from .evtx Files

If you have an exported `.evtx` file from another computer or you have back up an existing log, you can utilize the Get-WinEvent cmdlet to read and query those logs. This capability is particularly useful to auditing purposes or when you need to analyze logs within scripts. 

To retrieve logs entries from a `.evtx` file, you need to provide the log file's path using the `-Path` parameter. The example below demonstrates how to read events from the 'C:\Tools\chainsaw\EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES\Execution\exec_sysmon1_lolbin+pcalua.evtx' file, which represents an exported Windows PowerShell log. 

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Tools\chainsaw\EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES\Execution\exec_sysmon_1_lolbin_pcalua.evtx' -MaxEvents 5 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

TimeCreated           Id ProviderName             LevelDisplayName Message
-----------           -- ------------             ---------------- -------
5/12/2019 10:01:51 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
5/12/2019 10:01:50 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
5/12/2019 10:01:43 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
```

By specifying the path of the log file using the `-Path` parameter, we can retrieve events from that specific file. The command selects relevant properties and formats the output for easier analysis, displaying the event's creation time, ID, provider name, level display name, and message.
### 4. Filtering Events with FilterHashtable

To filter Windows event logs, we can use the `-FilterHashtable` parameter, which enables us to define specific conditions for the logs we want to retrieve.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1,3} | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

TimeCreated           Id ProviderName             LevelDisplayName Message
-----------           -- ------------             ---------------- -------
6/2/2023 10:40:09 AM   1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 10:39:01 AM   1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 10:34:12 AM   1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 10:33:26 AM   1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 10:33:16 AM   1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 9:36:10 AM    3 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Network connection detected:...
5/29/2023 6:30:26 PM   1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
5/29/2023 6:30:24 PM   3 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Network connection detected:...
```

The command above retrieves events with IDs 1 and 3 from the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` event log, selects specific properties from those events, and displays them in a table format. 

**Note**: if we observe Sysmon event IDs 1 and 3 (related to "dangerous" or uncommon binaries) occurring within a short time frame, it could potentially indicate the presence of a process communicating with a *Command and Control (C2) server*.

For exported events the equivalent command is the following:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Path='C:\Tools\chainsaw\EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES\Execution\sysmon_mshta_sharpshooter_stageless_meterpreter.evtx'; ID=1,3} | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

TimeCreated           Id ProviderName             LevelDisplayName Message
-----------           -- ------------             ---------------- -------
6/15/2019 12:14:32 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/15/2019 12:13:44 AM  3 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Network connection detected:...
6/15/2019 12:13:42 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
```

These logs are related to a process communicating with a Command and Control (C2) Server right after it was created. 

If we want to get event logs based on a date range (`5/28/23 - 6/2/2023`), this can be done as follows.

```powershell
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> $startDate = (Get-Date -Year 2023 -Month 5 -Day 28).Date
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> $endDate   = (Get-Date -Year 2023 -Month 6 -Day 3).Date
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1,3; StartTime=$startDate; EndTime=$endDate} | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

 TimeCreated           Id ProviderName             LevelDisplayName Message
-----------           -- ------------             ---------------- -------
6/2/2023 3:26:56 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:25:20 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:25:20 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:24:13 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:24:13 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:23:41 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:20:27 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
6/2/2023 3:20:26 PM    1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
--- SNIP ---
```

**Note**: The above will filter between the start data inclusive and the end date exclusive. That's why we specified June 3rd and not 2nd. 
### 5. Filtering Events with FilterHastable & XML

Consider an intrusion detection scenario where a suspicious network connect to a particular IP (`52.113.194.132`) has been identified. With Sysmon installed, you can use [Event ID 3 (Network Connection)](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90003) logs to investigate the potential threat.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=3} |
`ForEach-Object {
$xml = [xml]$_.ToXml()
$eventData = $xml.Event.EventData.Data
New-Object PSObject -Property @{
    SourceIP = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "SourceIp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
    DestinationIP = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "DestinationIp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
    ProcessGuid = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "ProcessGuid"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
    ProcessId = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "ProcessId"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
}
}  | Where-Object {$_.DestinationIP -eq "52.113.194.132"}

DestinationIP  ProcessId SourceIP       ProcessGuid
-------------  --------- --------       -----------
52.113.194.132 9196      10.129.205.123 {52ff3419-51ad-6475-1201-000000000e00}
52.113.194.132 5996      10.129.203.180 {52ff3419-54f3-6474-3d03-000000000c00}
```

This script will retrieve all Sysmon network connection events (ID 3), parse the XML data for each event to retrieve specific details (source IP, destination IP, Process GUID, and Process ID), and filter the results to include only events where the destination IP matches the suspected IP.

Further we can use the `ProcessGuid` to trace back the original process that made the connection, enabling us to understand the process tree and identify any malicious executables or scripts.

You might wonder how we could have been aware of `Event.EventData.Data`. The Windows XML Eventlog (EVTX) format can be found [here](https://github.com/libyal/libevtx/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20XML%20Event%20Log%20(EVTX).asciidoc).

In the "Tapping into ETW" section we were looking for anomalous `clr.dll` and `mscoree.dll` loading activity in processes that ordinarily wouldn't require them. The command below is leveraging Sysmon's Event ID 7 to detect the loading abovementioned DLLs.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $Query = @"
	<QueryList>
		<Query Id="0">
			<Select Path="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational">*[System[(EventID=7)]] and *[EventData[Data='mscoree.dll']] or *[EventData[Data='clr.dll']]
			</Select>
		</Query>
	</QueryList>
	"@
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterXml $Query | ForEach-Object {Write-Host $_.Message `n}

### 6. Filtering Events with FilterXPath

To use XPath queries with `Get-WinEvent`, we need to use the `-FilterXPath` parameter. This allows us to craft an XPath query to filter the event logs. 

For instance, if we want to get Process Creation ([Sysmon Event ID 1](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90001)) events in the Sysmon log to identify installation of any [Sysinterals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) tool we can use the command below. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**: During the installation of a Sysinternals tool the user must accept the presented EULA. The acceptance action involves the registry included in the command below.

```powershell
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' -FilterXPath "*[EventData[Data[@Name='Image']='C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe']] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='CommandLine']='`"C:\Windows\system32\reg.exe`" ADD HKCU\Software\Sysinternals /v EulaAccepted /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f']]" | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

 TimeCreated           Id ProviderName             LevelDisplayName Message
-----------           -- ------------             ---------------- -------
5/29/2023 12:44:46 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
5/29/2023 12:29:53 AM  1 Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon Information      Process Create:...
```

**Note**: `Image` and `CommandLine` can be identified by browsing the XML representation of any Sysmon event with ID 1 through, for example, Event Viewer.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WEoYPhO.png)

Lastly, suppose we want to investigate any network connections to a particular suspicious IP address (`52.113.194.132`) that Sysmon has logged. To do that we could use the following command. 

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' -FilterXPath "*[System[EventID=3] and EventData[Data[@Name='DestinationIp']='52.113.194.132']]"

ProviderName: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon

TimeCreated                      Id LevelDisplayName Message
-----------                      -- ---------------- -------
5/29/2023 6:30:24 PM              3 Information      Network connection detected:...
5/29/2023 12:32:05 AM             3 Information      Network connection detected:...

### 7. Filtering Events Based on Property Values

The `-Property *` parameter, when used with `Select-Object`, instructs the command to select all properties of the objects passed to it. In the context of the Get-WinEvent command, these properties will include all available information about the event. Let's see an example that will present us with all properties of Sysmon event ID 1 logs.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1} -MaxEvents 1 | Select-Object -Property *

Let's now see an example of a command that retrieves `Process Create` events from the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` log, checks the parent command line of each event for the string `-enc`, and then displays all properties of any matching events in a list.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1} | Where-Object {$_.Properties[21].Value -like "*-enc*"} | Format-List

- `| Where-Object {$._Properties[21].Value -like "*-enc*"`: This portion of the command further filters the retrieved events. The `|` character (pipe operator) passes the output of the previous command (i.e., the filtered events) to the `Where-Object` cmdlet. The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters the output based on the script block that follows it.
	- `$_`: In the script block, `$_` refers to the current object in the pipeline, i.e., each individual event that was retrieved and passed from the previous command.
	- `.Properties[21].Value`: The `Properties` property of a "Process Create" Sysmon event is an array containing various data about the event. The specific index `21` corresponds to the `ParentCommandLine` property of the event, which holds the exact command line used to start the process.

- `-like "*-enc*`: This is a comparison operator operator that matches strings based on a wildcard string, where `*` represents any sequence of characters. In this case, it's looking for any command lines that contain `-enc` anywhere within them. The `-enc` string might be part of suspicious commands, for example, it's a common parameter in PowerShell commands to denote an encoded command which could be used to obfuscate malicious scripts. 
- `| Format-List`: Finally, the output of the previous command (the events that meet the specified condition) is passed to the `Format-List` cmdlet. This cmdlet displays the properties of the input objects as a list, making it easier to read and analyze.
