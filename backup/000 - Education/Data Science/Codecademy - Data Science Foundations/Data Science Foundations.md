# What will you learn?

- articulate what can go right and what can go wring when working with data.
- query, manipulate, and analyze data in databases using SQL.
- write basic programs to create custom analyses in Python
- clean data to prepare it for analysis
- ask and answer questions using appropriate statistical measures

#### Exploring Data with SQL

> a **database** is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured into tables. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records.

SQL allows you to write **queries** which define the subset of data you are seeking. Unlike Excel and Sheets, your computer and SQL will handle how to get the data; you can focus on what data you would like. 

SQL is very human-readable. Without knowing any SQL, you can probably guess what each command will do.

#### Programming with Python

> After interacting with the database, it's time to analyze the data further and eventually visualize the data. And SQL cannot get us there alone.

**Python** is a general-purpose programming language. It can do almost all of what other languages can do with comparable, or faster, speed. 
- It is often chosen by data analysts and data scientists for prototyping, visualization, and execution of data analyses on datasets.

#### Normal Distributions

> *Inferential statistics* are used to find casual relationships

> *Descriptive statistics* are used to report on data

A lot of statistics is based on the idea of a distribution.

- Normal distributions are very common
	- Normal distributions mean that the mean is the middle of the distribution and the standard deviation is the width

# Data Literacy

> Organizations are fueled by data, and data scientists and analysts are at the forefront of working with it. But they don't work alone, and even the most technically sophisticated data scientist will need to communicate about data.

What will Data Literacy cover?

- Case studies about what can go wrong = and right in data projects
- Basic assumptions of working with different types of data
- How data types affect the analysis
- Foundational statistical ideas
- Key ideas behind good (and misleading) visualizations

After this unit, we will be able to:

- Spot messy data and make a plan to clean it
- Critically evaluate whether a statistical technique is a good idea
- Apply appropriate data manipulation methods
- Spot the difference between good and bad data visualizations
- Make a plan for how to transform a bad visualization into a good one
- Reference classic case studies involving perfect and poor data analysts

#### Data Gaps

> **Garbage in, garbage out** is a data-world phrase that means "our data driven conclusions are only as strong, robust, and well-supported as the data behind them."

Part of understanding and communicating with data means **asking the right questions so that we end up with useful, relevant data.** We can already answer lots of questions about heart attacks, but we won't learn the ins and outs of women's heart attacks by studying mostly men.

Part of practicing good data literacy means asking:

- Do we have sufficient data to answer the question at hand?
- Can my data answer my exact question?

#### Addressing Bias

One question the data on heart attacks might prompt is “why did the trials have only 38% female participation?”

In part, for historical reasons: in the 1950s, pregnant women in Europe and Canada were prescribed a drug called thalidomide for morning sickness. This drug resulted in severe birth defects and was taken off the market. As a result, in 1977 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended excluding from early-stage clinical trials all women who could become pregnant. While intended to protect women, the recommendation put them at risk in a different way, limiting our knowledge of the effects of drugs on women’s bodies.

The FDA reversed these recommendations in the 1990s, and today government-funded clinical trials **must** include women and other minorities. Yet, the trials don’t need to include minority groups at representative levels, and the majority of drug trials in the US aren’t government-funded anyway.

> Part of practicing good data literacy means asking...

- Who participated in the data?
- Who is left out?
- Who made the data?

#### What is Statistics?

Now let’s check out a case study that showcases the value of data literacy in the legal system.

Big, amorphous injustices like hiring discrimination are hard to prove in court. Hiring discrimination is a pattern of biased behavior towards candidates. This bias results in qualified candidates not getting hired because of their traits.

Throughout the 1900s, companies in the US were able to justify hiring on a case-by-case basis. After all, it’s legal to hire or not hire candidates based in part on soft qualities such as “fit” and “office culture.” But if these qualities are a mask for factors like a candidate’s race, gender, or religion, the company has broken anti-discrimination laws.

Usually, a lawyer would have to show the many individual cases that proved a company was discriminatory. Instead, lawyer Elaine W. Shoben shifted the burden of proof to companies. How was she able to do this with data literacy? She used the power of statistics! **Statistics helps us test the likelihood of an event happening by random chance versus systematically.**

#### High Stakes Visualizations

>Data visualization is one of the most visible and obvious places we interact with data. It helps us to explore and understand data-driven arguments and is a powerful tool for communication.

#### Numeracy

> Humans have some limitations when it comes to numbers

We're generally very good when it comes to numbers we can count, or numbers we can use in context. 

- Money makes a lot more sense in the context of coffee, bills or rent. 
- We can visualize those numbers and what they mean, and understand the consequences of them increasing decreasing by say, 20%

> With really big, or really small numbers, it takes a lot of care and attention to understand how big or how small the quantity is. 

**Part of an analysts job is to provide context and clarifications to make sure that audiences are not only reading the correct numbers, but understanding what they mean.**
