Six Step Troubleshooting Methodology

1. Identify the problem
    
2. Establish a theory of probable cause (questioning the obvious)
    
3. Test the theory to determine the cause. If the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory
    
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
    
5. Verify full system functionality. Implement preventative measures if possible.
    
6. Document the findings, actions and outcomes

> ARM produces less heat, and has extended battery life

> ARM is already becoming more popular even on Windows based systems like laptops and desktops

CPU Sockets

> Intel and AMD are main chip manufacturers

> determine what type of CPU based on the motherboard

> uses Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) to install into motherboard, meaning no pressure or force is necessary to install the CPU

> a Land Grid Array (LGA) is a form factor that positions all pins to connect the CPU processor into the socket

> a Pin Grid Array (PGA) - form factor where the processor has the pins and socket has the holes

 > a single socket architecture on desktop motherboards can only support one physical processor

> a mutli socket architecture can support multiple processor on one motherboard

CPU Features

Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)/Hyper-threading

> Single stream of instructions is being sent by a software application to a processor

> will do instructions sequentially and one at a time

Manufacturers developed a way to allow software to run multiple parallel threads at the same time, known as multi-threading

> Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) - traditional workstation and servers have multiple processors

- Not very useful on desktops and laptops
    

Multi-core processors 

> Single CPU with multiple processors inside

> Multiple cores exist inside of CPU

Dual-core processors

> two CPUs inside single chip

Quad-core processor

> four CPUs inside a single chip

Hexa-core processor

> 6 cores

Octa-core processor

> 8 cores

Virtualization - allows running multiple systems on a single physical host

> being able to emulate hardware that really doesn’t exist

> achieved with either VT (Intel) or AMD-V (AMD)

> provide processor extensions to support virtualization

> VMware, VirtualBox, Parallels are software components of virtualizations

> Intel has extended virtualization support on some processors, called Extended Page Table (EPT)

> AMD’s versions is Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI)

Motherboard Connections 

> Chip slot

> Memory Sockets - RAM

> Power connector socket

> CPU Power socket - 8 pin

> Several 4-pin connectors for case fans, 6 to 8

> USB Header Port - Provides USB to case

> SATA Ports - 6

> Power LED Connector

> USB Header Port - connects to port cluster

> Audio Header Port - headphone/microphone jack

> PCIe x 1 slot

> PCIe x16 - Graphics Cards / GPU, silver rimmed slot provides power

> M.2 connector - storage devices, M.2 based SSD cards

> M.2 Lightning connector

> CMOS Battery - keeps power to retain settings

> PS2 Port - outdated connector, popular in 80’s and 90’s

Installing Motherboard & CPU

> Ground yourself using an ESD strap to remove static electricity from your body 

> use ESD pad when working with motherboard

Expansion Cards

> PCIe and Mini-PCIe are main modern expansion cards

> PCI 32-bit cards support only a maximum bus speed of 33 Mhz or 133 MBps

- These cards are outdated and not capable for current amounts of data
    

> PCI-X 2.0 - 266Mhz bus up to 533MHz

- Fully backwards compatible
    

> PCI and PCI-X mostly used for audio or network

> Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)

- 1x
    
- 2x
    
- 3x
    
- 4x
    

> AGP was popular in the late 80’s and early 90’s

> PCIe replaced PCI, PCI-X and AGP

- PCIe x1
    
- PCIe x4
    
- PCIe x8
    
- PCI x16
    

> graphics cards tend to use PCIe x16 slots

> PCIe x1 is used for modems, network cards, wireless cars, I/O devices, lower data transfer rate modules

> Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) - connects to the bus to get data to and from the motherboard for external devices

> PCIe bus is determined by motherboard and it’s form factor

> Increase in PCIe - x1 is slower than PCIe x16 and so on and so forth

> newer versions are typically faster than older versions (1.0, 2.0, etc)

> PCIe slots provide 25 watts of power, PCIe x16 provides 75 watts

> PCIe x1 slots can only take PCIe x1 cards, but a PCIe x16 slot can take a PCIe x1 and detect it and downgrade to an x1 (up-plugging)

> down-plugging  is when you put a larger card in a smaller slot, but will only work at that slots speed (not-recommended)

> Mini-PCIe - works just like a full size PCIe but has a smaller form factor

Expansion Card Types

> contain Graphics Processing Unit, which removes the burden of rendering graphics from motherboard

> High Speed Memory are included on most graphics cards to also remove the burden on the CPU and RAM to have dedicated memory for graphics processing

> Video Capture Cards - takes video signals and processes them inside the computer

> Network Interface Card - installed into PCIe x1 slot to increase network capacity to 10 Gbps

- ST / SC / MT-RJ connector cards can be used to support a fiber optic cable connection
    

> Riser Card - special type of expansion card on a motherboard, allows you to install components into ports horizontally instead of vertically. Useful for smaller form factor PCs

Installing Expansion Cards

> use Antistatic mat and a grounding wrist strap before working on components

> install GPU in PCIe x16 slot

> attach GPU to the open slot on the rear of the case with screws to alleviate weight on the motherboard and PCIe x16 slot

Cooling and Power

> Passive cooling

> Active cooling

> Liquid cooling

> Computers rely on direct current, wall outlets provide alternating current

  

Passive cooling - type of cooling that doesn’t rely on moving parts or power

Heat sink - finned metal device that radiates heat away from the processor

Active cooling - uses a fan to cool down the heat from the device

- Top of the processor heatsink + fan
    
- Case fans, attached to exterior of case to bring airflow inside
    
- Back of the power supply, feeds air into the power supply
    
- Attached to graphics card
    

> Fans can have excess dust attach to them, slowing them down and lowering efficiency.

Liquid Cooling

> closed loop systems

- Cooling of a single component
    

> open loop systems

- Liquid cooling based system of different components
    

> Water and liquids are more effective coolants than air convection

> Liquid cooling is used most on high performance systems

Installing Active Cooling

> apply thermal paste to the top of the processor

4 parts must be installed in order for cooling to be installed correctly

1. CPU
    
2. Thermal Paste
    
3. Heatsink
    
4. Cooling Fans
    

Power Supply Unit

> provide the power the computer and it’s components the power to function

> Alternating Current (AC) is cycled between positives and negatives repeatedly at an interval of 60Hz

> Main purpose of power supply is to deliver DC to all components inside the PC when receiving an AC power supply. It uses a transformer and series of regulators to do this.

> Power supply will drop from 110 or 120V AC in the US to 12V like in the EU. 

> Modular PSU / Modular Power Supply Unit - allows to unhook the connectors and detach from the unit

- Modular power supply frees up space inside the computer
    

> Some systems will have more than one power supply. In critical systems, select a motherboard that will support multiple power supplies in case one of those power supplies fails to keep the system running.

Power Supply Connectors

> Main Board / Motherboard adapter - provides power to the motherboard

> ATX Standard - outdated 20-pin connector

>> ATX 12V -24-pin connector

>>  20+4 Pin -  Two connectors are coupled together before plugging into a 24-pin connector

- The allows for backwards compatibility with 20-pin connector boards
    

>> Processor Power/CPU Power - has a four, six or eight pin connector

>> SATA Power Connector - look like SATA data cable

>> Molex Connector - used for IDE and PATA hard disks, CDs, and DVD drive

>> Y-Connector - one connector that can support multiple devices

Input and Output Voltages

> 120V AC (Low Line Power) - US-based power supply

> 230V AC (High Line Power) - Europe and Asia Power Supply

> If you have a device that can support both power types, you can use electricity all over the world

> Modern power supplies are Voltage Sensing / Dual Voltage Power Supplies - meaning they detect the outlet and converts it into the voltage of DC.

  

> What is the source to be provided for that power supply?

- The power supply will convert and use rectifiers to turn the supplied power into the 3 voltages needed for our systems:
    

1. 3.3 VDC
    
2. 5 VDC
    
3. 12 VDC
    

- Once the power supply creates these 3 voltages, they will be sent through the system via various connectors discussed earlier.
    

> Systems will use these types of voltages: 

- +12 and -12 VDC
    
- +3.3 VDC
    
- +5 VDC
    

> Rail - a wire that provides current at a particular voltage

> 12 VDC is the most important voltage, as it is the most common in the PC. 

Wattage Rating

> Wattage Rating -  Power supply’s output capacity or capability

- Measured in Watts
    

> The better the hardware, the more Wattage it will draw. This is important when picking out components for a PC or build.

> All power inside the system is delivered from the power supply.

> Amperage to Wattage

- A * V and I * V
    

> Buy a power supply that is bigger than calculator

> How much power is drawn from the wall outlet?

- A 500 watt power supply that is 70% efficient will draw 714 watts
    
- This means that the wall outlet is drawing 714 watts and only producing 500 watts at a 70% efficiency rate
    
- The excess is lost in the form of heat.
    

> EnergyStar rated power supplies can give 80% power efficiency, which translates to lower energy bills.

> If for instance you are running a server farm, you want the highest power efficiency possible to save on energy costs at scale.

Random Access Memories (RAM)

> used to load applications and files into a non-persistent and fast storage area

> Office PCs need about 8gb, gaming PCs need about 16gb to 32gb

Addressing Memory

> Cache - high speed memory, small amount of space

> Random Access Memory is next in the memory list

> Storage (Hard Drives, SSDs) hold much more data, but are much slower

> when data stored on a storage drive is opened, that data is sent to the RAM, then the cache to be worked on by the processor

> Mass Storage Devices

- Permanent storage area
    

> Random Access Memory

- Temporary storage area / non-persistent storage
    
- Files are moved to Ram when being worked on, then lost when the machine is powered off
    

> Memory serves as a  disk cache - pulls files from the disc into memory and replaces the old file

> Mass storage devices are a mechanical system, RAM is an electronic system

> RAM is considered a solid state device

> Addressing Memory - processor reaching the files inside RAM

- Memory controller exists between the memory and CPU
    
- An x86 or 32-bit processor can address a maximum of 4GB of RAM
    
- X64 or 64-bit processor can access more than 4GB of RAM (8, 16, 32, 64)
    

  

Memory Modules

Single Bank - can put any size of module in any slot

Paired Bank - requires installation of banks in pairs of RAM cards

> RAM banks operate on versions, such as DDR3, DDR4, DDR5. The higher the number, the better the version.

- These upgrades require upgrades to the motherboard as well for compatible RAM slots
    
- DDR stands for Dual Data Rate
    

> PC133 Memory = 133Mhz

> Throughput is calculated based on the bus speed and the width of the data bus

>> Types of Memory

- Dynamic RAM (DRAM) - oldest type of memory that requires frequent refresh
    
- Static RAM (SRAM) - solved issue of constant refresh, but was expensive
    
- Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) - first memory module that operates at the same speed as the motherboard bus
    
- Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory - doubles the transfer speed of an SRAM module (184-pin connector)
    
- DDR2 SRAM same as above, ^^ better speeds and 240-pin connectors (PC2-4200)
    
- DDR3 SDRAM - runs at lower voltage and at a higher speed than DDR2 (240 keyed pin connector) - PC3-10600 or 10.6GB/S throughput is 6.4 to 17
    
- DDR4 -12.8 to 25.6GB/S of throughput 128GB per module
    
- SODIMM - Small Outline Dual in Line Memory Module - still classified as DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 - designed for smaller form factor machines
    

Multi-Channel Memory

> uses two different memory modules to increase the performance and throughput

> single-channel memory - 64bit data bus

> Dual-channel memory -128bit data bus

> Triple-Channel - uses three memory modules and three memory slots (192-bit data bus)

> Quad-Channel - uses four memory modules and four memory slots (256-bit data bus)

> In multi-channel configurations, use the same model, speed and throughput of memory

ECC Memory

> Non-Parity Memory - standard memory that does not check for errors and allows data to be put in or taken out

> Parity Memory - Performs basic error checking and ensures the memory contents are reliable

> A parity check does a basic calculation

- Every bit has an associated parity bit
    
- Bits can only be a zero or a one
    

> Error Correcting Code (ECC) - detects and corrects and error. A little bit slower than non-parity and parity memory.

- Used in really high end servers and workstations
    

> Buffered / Registered Memory - additional hardware (register) between memory and CPU

> The system requires buffering or registering the data to reduce the electrical load

> Your motherboard has to support ECC for ECC supported components to work

- All RAM modules must be either ECC or non-ECC for them to work, motherboards are often ECC only or incompatible.
    

> DDR5 does have an internal error checking for its modules

Virtual Memory

> Virtual Memory or Page File is space on a hard drive that is allocated by the OS and pretends to be memory

> emulates that a computer has more memory than it actually does

> virtual memory is more of a last resort and if it is constantly being used the machine probably needs a RAM upgrade

> a page file or swap space is hidden on a storage device and pretends to be system memory

    Stored as firmware (software on a chip) in the flash memory of a motherboard
    

> UEFI is the more modern variant on x64 architecture

- Provides a GUI
    
- Better security
    

Boot Options

> BIOS - program a computer’s microprocessor uses to start and boot after being turned on

> Most common example of firmware, first software run by a computer

> BIOS is stored in ROM (read only memory)

- Type of chip embedded in the motherboard and can be upgraded through flashing
    
- CMOS - battery powered memory chip, built into motherboard
    
- CMOS usually last 3 years, new ones last 10 year
    
- CR2032 battery - when date and time is lost constantly, the CMOS is probably dead
    

> Power-On Self Test (POST)

- Diagnostic testing sequence to check the computers basic input/output system
    
- Variable beeps are used as a way to tell what is wrong with the system - short and long beeps. Pattern of beeps indicates the problem communicating to the user. 
    

> TO configure settings inside CMOS, enter the BIOS configuration environment - most common keys to access this are F2, DEL, ESC, F1, F10, F12

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

> Updated form of BIOS that allows keyboard and mouse as input and provides a GUI.

> UEFI Supports larger HDDS and SSDs (9.4 zettabytes)

> Supports the new GUID Partition Table (GPT) format

> UEFI is faster at booting up a system than BIOS

> Uses a larger ROM size than BIOS

> In most corporate environments, booting from an optical drive is disabled in order to prevent hackers from loading malware via disks to access a system

> Configure the system to boot from the installed hard drive using the installed OS instead of optical drive

Flashing - performed during upgrades, security fixes or feature improvements

- Backup configuration and data before flashing
    
- Needs a USB flash drive to flash the firmware while pressing series of specified keys
    
- UEFI or BIOS will copy the firmware to the system and overwrite the old code
    

UEFI and BIOS Security

> Supervisor/Admin/Setup password

> User/System Password

> Storage/Hard Drive

- SysAdminSetup password is used to protect access to the BIOS or UEFI configuration program and prevents access from unauthorized users. Set up on corporate or enterprise networks
    
- User/System - used to lock access to the entire computer, almost never used in corporate/enterprise networks
    
- Storage/Hard Drive - lock access to a hard drive on a system, requiring user to enter password to access data
    

> Secure Boot - enabled in UEFI interface only, and setting and is not supported by BIOS

- Verifies there is not malicious code within the system
    
- Ensures operating system can be trusted and is not infected with a rootkit
    

> Permissions for USB ports

- Modern systems are configured to enable or disable the USB ports on the motherboard
    
- Main concerns are malware and data loss
    
- Prevents unknown USB drives by being plugged in and read/writing to disk to copy malware onto a system
    
- Disabling read/write still allows use of headphones/mice/keyboards etc.
    
- Also prevents data from leaving the system, with data loaded from a system onto a thumb drive

> When it comes to Security, there are 3 main things that your UEFI or BIOS can provide you with:

- Set passwords
    
- Enable secure boot
    
- Restrict or disable USB ports 
    

TPM and HSM (OBJ 3.4)

> Trusted Platform Model & Hardware Security Module

> Hardware Root of Trust (RoT) - foundation of all secure operations of a computing system

- Cryptographic module embedded in a computer system that endorses trusted execution and attests to boot settings and metrics
    
- Used to scan boot metrics in the OS files to verify signatures and then use them to sign the report
    
- Embedded as part of a chip
    

> Trusted Platform Module - specification for hardware based storage of digital certificates keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information

- Hard-coded with endorsement key
    
- Used to verify that kernels and deep system components have not been tampered with

> Remember for exam: TPM is a hardware RoT and ensures a secure boot-up, TPM also provides encryption for storage devices

> TPM can be managed in Windows via tpm.msc or group policy editor

> May be asked to modify and configure TPM in IT career, so review documentation from microsoft.com

Configuring the Bios

> Arrow keys control the BIOS

> Devices tab covers all connected I/O devices and USB devices

> Enable hibernation  on laptops to create a sleep state for the computer (if it’s closed, it saves the state of the machine prior to closing it)

> Hyperthreading allows software to use multiple CPU cores, improving performance

> BIOS is used less often in modern systems and organizations

Configuring the UEFI

> Lots of capability and settings and more than BIOS, but does essentially the same thing as a BIOS

Storage Devices

> Hard Disk Drives (HDD) - mass storage device

> Storage device that holds the data when the system is powered down

> Internal vs. External devices

- Internal are components installed inside the computer
    
- External drives are placed on the exterior of case and connected through external port
    

> 5400, 7200 , 10,000, 15,000 RPM HHDs are available

- Higher speed HDDs become more expensive, often costing more than an SSD
    

> Buffer Size - 8MB to 256MB, generally the larger buffer means better performance

> HDDs use SATA cables to connect to hard drive

Solid State Drive

> Uses flash memory technology to implement persistent mass storage

> Much faster and more durable than HDDs

> M.2 type SSDs have NVMe and PCIe connections that can be connected directly to motherboard

- PCIe slots on motherboard can be used with a M.2 SSD
    

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)

> RAID 0, 1, 5, 6 and 10

> RAID 0: Striping 

> RAID 0 is great for speed but provides no data redundancy

> RAID 0 has no loss of space on the disk

> RAID 1 - mirroring and redundancy - everything put on disk zero is also put on disk 1, creating redundancy

- Loss of space on one of the disks is main drawback
    

> RAID 5 - redundancy through parity: uses 3 disks minimum, used in most server environments and small businesses

> RAID 6 - Striping with Dual Parity

> RAID 10 - mirroring + striping: 4 disks, larger RAID 1 configuration, great speed and great redundancy. 

> RAID 1 is best for redundancy

> RAIDs can be categorized as:

- Failure Resistant - protects against loss of data (RAID 1, 5)
    
- Fault Tolerant - can function even if a component fails (RAID 1, 5, 6)
    
- Disaster Tolerant - RAID with 2 independent zones with full data access (RAID 10)
    

Removable Storage

> Hot-Swappable - capable of being removed or replaced without disruption or powering off the device

- USB
    
- Thunderbolt
    
- eSATA
    

> Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) - technical standard developed by Intel that allows hot-swappable capability with SATA devices

- Must be enabled in UEFI
    

> Flash Drives/Thumb Drives

- Typically comes with a USB Connection
    
- Small and portable
    

  

> Memory Cards 

- SD
    
- MiniSD
    
- MicroSD
    
- CompactFlash
    
- Memory Stick
    

> SD cards have vastly different read/write speeds

- OG - 25MB/s
    
- UHS-1 -108MB/s
    
- UHS-2 - 312MB/s
    
- UHS-3 - 624MB/s
    

Tape Drives - not used often in personal machines, very common on server setups

- Losing popularity to cloud based backups
    
- Magnetic tape inside of plastic case, allows a copy of data onto tape drive
    
- Can be shipped off to other locations since it is a physical object
    

> Standard tapes usually hold 140GB

> LTO Ultrium tapes can hold 3TB of data

Floppy Drives - really old legacy way of storing data

- Around in 1970s, 80s and 90s
    
- Not typically used unless in a legacy environment
    
- Can only hold 1.44MB of data, basically useless in modern systems
    

Key Takeaways from OBJ 3.3

> a removable mass storage device is any device that can store data and be carried

> an external hard drive or SSD as same as inside the system 

Optical Drives

> come in three varieties

- CD (compact disc)
    
- DVD (digital versatile disc)
    
- BD (Blu-ray disc)
    

> DVD stores 4.7 or 8.4 GB of data, enough for movies and video content

> Blu-ray can hold 25GB or 50GB of data in the Dual Layer format

>DVD and BLURAY come in 3 main forms

- Read-Only
    
- Write-Once (R) - writing that cannot be erased
    
- Write-Many (CD-RW) - allowed to read and write unlimited amount of times
    

> DVD-RAM discs have a different form factor to DVD-RW

> Blu-Ray Disc (BD-RE) (record-erasable)

How fast are optical drives?

- Optical drives are measured in X rating
    
- 1X - music
    
- 2X/4X/16X/64X
    

Key Takeaways 

> Storage sizes for different discs:

- CD - 650-700MB
    
- DVD - 4.7 GB or 8.4GB (DL)
    
- Blu-ray - 25GB or GB (DL)
    

Configuring a RAID

> done from the UEFI ->>> “Create RAID Volume”

> For a RAID5 drive selecting for parity and redundancy, you must select a minimum of 3 disks.

> RAID1 would only use 2 disk, RAID10 would use 4.

> RAID0 is best for speed, and only needs 1 disk

Virtualization (OBJ 4.2)

> at the heart of cloud computing

> allow you to run multiple operating systems on a single piece of hardware

> host computer installed with a hypervisor that can be used to install and manage multiple guest operating systems or virtual machines (VMs)

- Type 1 Hypervisor
    

- Runs directly on host hardware and functions as the operating system
    

  

- Type 2 Hypervisor
    

- Runs within the normal operating system
    

> Ensure that each virtual machine runs its own copy of an operating system

- Server-based (Terminal services)
    

- Server-based solution that runs the application on servers in a centralized location
    

  

- Client-based (Application streaming)
    

- Client-based solution that allows an application to be packaged up and streamed directly to user’s PC
    

Containerization

- Type of virtualization applied by a host operating system to provision an isolated execution environment for an application
    

- Docker
    
- Parallels Virtuozzo
    
- OpenVZ
    

> If data servers are contracted out to a third party, there is a possibility they are hosting other data from another company that is not properly secured. 

1. When a physical server crashes, all the organizations hosted on that same server are affected
    
2. An organization's failure to secure the virtual environments hosted on a shared server poses a security risk for the other organizations
    

- Set up virtual server on the cloud with proper failover, redundancy, and elasticity
    
- Hosting all VMs on the same type of hypervisor can also be exploited
    
- To minimize risks, consider doing:
    

1. Proper Configurations
    
2. Patched and up-to-date hypervisor
    
3. Tight access control
    

       3. Because containers are logically segmented they cannot actually communicate with each other, which is great for security. 

> If an attacker breaches the host OS underneath the container layer and container manager layer, the attacker has access to all segments in the data. 

Purposes of VMs

> Hypervisor - manages the distribution of the physical resources of a server to the virtual machines

- Manages the distribution of the physical resources of a server to the VMs
    

- Type 1 - Bare Metal - faster and more efficient
    
- Type 2 - Hosted
    

- Container-based Virtualization (Containerization)
    

- Each container relies on a common host OS as the base for each container
    
- Container-based virtualization has less resources because it doesn’t require its own copy of the OS for individual container
    

- Hyper Converged infrastructure
    

- Allows for full integration of the storage, network and servers without hardware changes
    

- Application Virtualization
    

- Encapsulates computer programs from the underlying OS on which they are executed

- Lots of security and cost benefits to this approach - requires less hardware, and virtual machines are created when a user logs in and destroyed when they log off
    

- Sandbox
    

- An isolated environment for analyzing pieces of malware
    

- Cross-Platform Virtualization
    

- Allows for testing and running of software applications for different OS

- X64 based processor
    

- 16 exabytes of RAM
    
- 32-bit processor cannot run a 64bit application
    

- ARM 
    

- Reduced instruction set and computer architecture in a computer
    

- System Memory
    

- Amount of physical memory installed on a physical server
    
- Barebones windows installation takes 20-50 GB of space
    
- Linux installation takes 4-8 GB of space
    
- Mac environment takes 20-40 GB of space
    

- NIC teaming configuration allows multiple cards for higher space
    

- CPU, processor, and capabilities
    
- System Memory
    
- Networking
    
- Storage
    

  
  

 Security Requirements

- VM Escape
    

- Threat attempts to get out of an isolated VM and send commands to the underlying hypervisor
    
- VM escape is easier to perform on a Type II hypervisor than a Type 1 hypervisor
    

- Patched 
    
- Up to date
    

- VM Hopping
    

- Threat attempts to move from one VM to another on the same host

- Patched
    
- Up to date
    
- Strong endpoint software protection
    
- Limited extension or add ons
    

- Live Migration
    

- Migrates the virtual machine from one host to another while it is running
    
- Ensure that live migration only occurs on a trusted network or utilizes encryption
    
- Virtual machine images should be encrypted before being sent from one machine to the other
    

- Data Remnants
    

- Leftover pieces of data that may exist in the hard drive which are no longer needed
    

- Encrypt virtual machine storage location
    
- Destroy encryption key
    

- VM Sprawl
    

- Uncontrolled deployment of virtual machines
    
- Uncontrolled and unconfigured machines become very susceptible to attack
    
- Once a sprawled VM is breached, it can be used at an access point into other parts of a network

Wireless Networks

> OBJ 2.3 - Compare and contrast protocols for wireless networking

Wireless Frequencies

- Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
    

- Modulates data over an entire range of frequencies using a series of signals known as chips
    
- Chips are more susceptible to EMI
    
- Uses entire spectrum of frequency band to transmit data
    

- Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
    

- Allows devices to hop between predetermined frequencies
    

- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
    

- Uses a slow modulation rate with simultaneous transmissions over 52 different data streams
    

- Each band has specific frequencies/channels to avoid overlapping with other signals
    

> Channel

- A virtual medium through which wireless networks can send and receive data
    

- For the 2.4GHz spectrum, there can be 11 or 14 channels
    

- US only allows you to use 11 channels, 2401-2473 MHz
    
- Rest of World allows you to use 13 channels, 2401-2483 MHz
    
- Japan uses 14 channels, 2401-2495 MHz
    

- Channels 1, 6 and 11 avoid overlapping frequencies in the 2.4 GHz band
    

- Most important channels for the 2.4 GHz spectrum
    
- Far enough apart from each other to avoid any interference
    

- We can use 5.725-5.875GHz to run our wireless networks in the 5 GHz band
    
- There are 24 non-overlapping channels in the 5 GHz band

- Acts more like a “hub”
    

- Multiple User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO)
    

- Allows multiple users to access the wireless networks in the area
    
- Forces users to share bandwidth. Bandwidth is higher for the lower amount of users on the network
    
- Acts more like a “switch”
    

- Radio Frequency Interference
    

- Occurs when there are similar frequencies to wireless networks in the area
    
- 2.4 GHz band is fairly crowded
    
- As more devices move to 5GHz, that spectrum will get crowded as well
    

- As signal decreases in strength or interference increases, the signal-to-noise ratio worsens
    
- This causes additional re-transmissions, which causes additional network baggage. Retransmissions cause network slowdowns.
    

> Wireless Security

- Wireless networks bring a lot of security risks
    
- Know what your devices are connecting to, and once theyre connected, the data being sent is encrypted
    
- Pre-shared key
    

- Both the access point and the client use device have the same encryption key
    
- Scalability becomes an issue with pre-shared keys
    

- If an employee who knows the pre-shared key is terminated, now the other employees have to be told the new key in order to access the network, all because of that single employee.
    

- It’s not a good idea to use a pre-shared key in large environments
    

- WEP
    

- Original 802.11 wireless security standard which is an insecure security protocol
    
- Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
    
- Should never use this in the modern IT era
    

- Originally had a 40-bit encryption key, which is easy to brute force
    
- Later upgraded to 64-bit and 128-bit keys
    
- Created a different problem known as the initialization vector
    

- 24-bit initialization vector is sent in clear text. If enough are captured, you can backwards crack the encryption key
    

- WPA - WiFi Protected Access
    

- Replaced WEP and follows the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
    
- Replaces Initialization Vector with a 48-bit key
    
- Added new encryption type, RC4 - Rivest Cipher 4
    
- Message Integrity Check - (MIC)
    

- To confirm data was not modified in transit
    

- Enterprise Mode - Allows authentication of users before exchanging keys
    
- Considered weak by today’s standards
    

- WPA2 - WiFi protected access 2
    

- Created as part of IEEE 802.11i standard and requires stronger encryption and integrity checking the CCMP
    
- CCMP = WPA2 Security 
    
- AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
    

- To provide additional security by using at 128-bit key or higher
    

- Personal Mode
    

- Pre-shared key
    

- Enterprise Mode
    

- Centralized authentication server
    

- For the exam:
    

- Open means no security or protection
    
- WEP means IV, or Initialization Vectors
    
- WPA = TKIP and RC4
    

- TKIP replaces Initialization Vectors,
    
- RC4 isthe form of encryption
    

- WPA2 = CCMP and AES
    

- CCMP is integrity protocol
    
- AES is encryption methodology
    

- MAC Address Filtering
    

- Permit or deny certain MAC addresses to connect to the network
    
- It’s quite easy to spoof or change your MAC address
    

- Not foolproof
    
- Not a great source of protection, but is asked on the exam
    

- Disabling SSID Broadcast
    

- Minor security help
    
- Configures an access point not to broadcast the name of the wireless LAN
    
- Server Set Identifier 
    
- Using wireless penetration techniques, this ID is easy to find for experienced users

- Geosynchronous orbit
    

- One satellite can cover a large portion of the Earth
    
- Geosynchronous orbit gives higher latency and lower quality 
    

- Microwave and Satellite have more regulations due to FCC and them being large infrastructure

Introduction to IP

> Efficiently move large amounts of data: “shipping truck”

> The network topology is the road

- Ethernet, DSL, cable system
    

> Truck is the Internet Protocol

- Roads are designed for this truck
    

> The boxes on the truck hold your data

- Boxes of TCP and UDP
    
- Truck has no idea what is inside the boxes
    

> Inside the boxes are more things:

- Application data

TCP and UDP

- Transported inside of the IP protocol
    

- Encapsulated within IP
    
- Common ways to move data from place to place
    

- OSI Layer 4 -
    

- Transport layer
    

- Multiplexing
    

- Use many different applications at the same time
    
- TCP and UDP do this, IP cannot handle multiple apps without multiplexing
    

  

- Transmission Control Protocol
    

- A formal connection setup and close
    
- “Reliable” delivery
    

- Recovery from erors
    
- Can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions
    
- Built in system to verify information has been sent and received
    

- Flow Control
    

- Receiver can manage how much data is sent
    

- UDP - User Datagram Protocol
    

- Connectionless
    

- No Formal open or close to the connection
    

- “Unreliable” delivery
    

- No receipt or knowledge that information was received.
    

- No Flow Control with UDP
    

- Sender determines amount of data transmitted
    

- Real-time communication
    

- No way to stop and resend the data
    
- Time doesn’t stop for your network
    
- Simply send the data, if the information was lost the connection stays active whether data made it or not
    

- Connectionless protocols
    

- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    

- Responsible for resending lost data
    

- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
    

- The data might not get through
    

- The application keeps track and decides what to do
    
- It might not do anything
    

  

- Connection-oriented protocols prefer a “return script”
    

- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
    
- SSH (Secure Shell)
    

- The application doesn’t worry about out of order frame sor mussing data
    

- TCP handles all of the communication overhead
    
- The application has one job
    

  

> The IP truck delivers from one IP address to another IP address

- Box arrives at the house
    

- Where do the boxes go?
    
- Each box has a room name
    

- TCP/UDP controls the flow of the box to the correct room
    

- Uses Ports to determine this
    
- Each room has a port number
    

Lots of Ports

- IPv4 sockets:
    

- Server IP address, protocol, server application port number
    
- Client IP address, protocol, client port number
    

- Non-ephemeral ports - permanent port numbers
    

- Same port numbers so the location stays the same (non-ephemeral)
    
- Ports 0 to 1,023
    
- Usually on a server or service
    

- Ephemeral ports - temporary port numbers
    

- 1,024 and 65,535
    
- Determined in real time by the client
    

- TCP and UDP can use all available port numbers
    
- Most servers use non-ephemeral ports
    

- Not always the case
    
- It’s just a number
    

- Port numbers are for communication, not security
    

- Designed to allow connection to services
    
- Port scanners find all available ports
    

- Service port numbers need to be “well-known”
    

- Allows for ease of use to determine the location quickly
    

  

Common Network Ports

> Well known port number

- Client and server need to match
    

> Important for Firewall rules

Ports on the Network

> Dotted-Decimal Notation

- 8 octets that determine IP address: 172.0.0.1 as an example.
    
- 32 bits of total addressable space
    
- Dotted decimal is converted to binary based on the IP address
    

- Less mistake prone that using binary
    

IPv4 - Dion Training Course Portion

> Example of dotted decimal notation which is used in IP

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|10|1|2|3|
|172|21|243|67|

  
  

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
||1st Octet|2nd Octet|3rd Octet|4th Octet|
|Dotted Decimal|192|168|1|4|
|Binary Digits|11000000|10101000|00000001|00000100|
|Subnet Mask|255|255|255|0|
|Subnet Mask|11111111|111111111|11111111|00000000|
||||||

  

> Multicast Address 

- Logical identifier for a group of hoses in a computer network
    
- Think of a Facebook group chat - sent from one person to multiple people at the same time
    
- Class E IP address - reserved for future use
    

> Classful mask

- Default subnet mask for a given class of IP addresses
    

> Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

- Allows for borrowing some of the host bits and reassigning them to the network portion
    

> Public (Routable)

- Can be accessed over the internet and is assigned to the network by an Internet service provider
    

> Private (Non-routable)

- Can be used by anyone any time, but only within their own local area network
    
- Private IP ranges include those that start with either 10, 172, or 192
    

> When a private IP is routed to the wider internet, a NAT device converts the private IPs into public IPs through the router or modem, allowing private IPs to be used multiple times in different LANs

> Network Address Translation (NAT)

- Allows for routing of private IPs through a public IP
    

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Class|Starting Value|IP Range|Possible Hosts|
|A|10|10.0.0.0-<br><br>10.255.255.255|16.7 million<br><br>(256 x 256 x 256)|
|B|172.16 - 172.31|172.16.0.0 -<br><br>172.31.255.255|1.05 million<br><br>(16 x 256 x 256)|
|C|192.168|192.168.0.0<br><br>192.168.255.255|65,536<br><br>(256x256)|

  
  

> Loopback Address (127.0.0.1)

- Creates a loopback to the host and is often used in troubleshooting and testing network protocols on a system
    
- “Local Host” (on port 80, open port)
    

> Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)

- Used when a device does not have a static IP address or cannot reach a DHCP server
    

- 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255

> Assigning IPv4 Addresses

- Static Assignment
    

- Manually type the IP address for the host, its subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server.
    
- Static assignment of IP addresses is impractical on large enterprise networks.
    
- Easy for human error to cause assignment issues, fat fingering, incorrect input, etc.
    

- Dynamic Assignment
    

- Dynamic allocation of IP addresses
    
- Quicker, easier and less confusion
    
- Best option for larger enterprises and small businesses or SoHo networks
    

- Dynamic and Static:

- Bootstrap Protocol
    

- Dynamically assigns IP addresses and allows a workstation to load a copy  of boot image to the network
    
- Uses static database of IPs and MAC addresses
    

- Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)
    

- DHCP provides the IP, Subnet mask, Default gateway, and DNS/Wins server automatically
    
- Assigns an IP based on an assignable scope or addresses and provides the ability to configure other options
    
- 192.168.1.100 through 192.168.1.200
    

- Each IP is leased for a period of time and returns to the pool when the lease expires
    
- Once the lease expires, it returns to the pool to be assigned again
    

- IP Address Management
    

- Manages the IP being assigned and returned over time
    
- Users do not have to keep track of all of it manually
    

- DHCP is the modern implementation of BOOTP
    
- Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
    

- Used when a device does not have a static IP address or cannot reach a DHCP server
    
- Allows for the quick configuration of a LAN without the need for a DHCP server
    
- APIPA-assigned devices cannot communicate outside the LAN or with non-APIPA devices
    

- Zero-Configuration
    

- New tech that provides the same features as APIPA
    
- Assign an IPv4 link-local address to a client

- Unicast Address
    

- Used to identify a single interface
    

- Globally routed
    

- Like IPv4’s unicast A, B and C addresses and begins with 2000-3999
    

- Link-Local/Local Use
    

- Used like a private IP in IPv4 that can only be used on the local area network and begins with FE80
    

- Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    

- Eliminates the need to obtain addresses or other configuration information from a central server
    

- Multicast Address
    

- Used to identify a set of interfaces and begins with FF
    

- Anycast Address
    

- Used to identify a set of interfaces so that a packet can be sent to any member of a set
    
- No way to tell if an IPv6 is Unicast or Anycast by looking at IPv6 address
    

- Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)
    

- Allows a host to assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv6 interface identifier called EUI-64
    

- DHCPv6 Protocol
    

- Allows DHCP to automatically assign addresses from a DHCPv6 server
    
- EUI makes DHCPv6 less relevant if present
    

- Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
    

- Used to determine the Layer 2 addresses that are on a given network
    

Ports & Protocols

- Port
    

- Logical communication endpoint that exists on a computer or server
    

- Inbound Port
    

- Logical communication opening on a server that is listening for a connection from a client
    

- Outbound Port
    

- Logical communication opening created on a client to call out to a server that is listening for a connection
    

- Ports can be any number between 0 and 65,535
    
- Well-Known Ports
    

- Ports 0-1023 are considered well known and are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
    

- Registered Ports
    

- Ports 1024 to 49151 are considered registered and are usually assigned to proprietary protocols
    

- Dynamic or Private Ports
    

- Ports 49152 to 65535 can be used by any application without being registered with IANA
    
- Dynamic or Private Ports are commonly used for gaming, instant messaging, and chat

- Domain Name Service (DNS)
    

- Port 53
    
- Converts domain names to IP addresses and IP address to domain names
    

- DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    

- Ports 67, 68
