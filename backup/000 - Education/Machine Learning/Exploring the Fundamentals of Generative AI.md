Have you ever wondered if that eye-catching billboard you just passed by was designed by a human or created by AI?

In today’s world, AI is doing far more than just automating tasks—creating art, composing music, writing stories, and even building websites. With our free **generative AI** course, you’ll discover how AI transforms creativity across industries. From generating stunning images and composing music to designing logos, this course will show you how AI tools open up new possibilities for creators everywhere while helping you earn a valuable generative AI certification.

## What is generative AI?

**Generative AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating content, such as images, text, music, etc. Unlike traditional AI, which typically follows preprogrammed rules, generative AI models learn from large datasets and can generate new outputs based on that learning. This technology has rapidly gained popularity, enabling us to create AI-generated images, music, and stories with minimal effort. Let’s look at some inspiring examples of generative AI.

## Generative AI in action

Here, we’ll explore the power of AI-driven image generation with our interactive tool. We’ll simply click the “Generate Image” button to create unique scenes, such as a cat in a forest, and watch as the magic happens!

> **Note:** These images are created using Gemini.

Generative AI also helps with code generation, as illustrated below. In the example below, we have an impressive signature application whose code is generated in AI in an instant, showcasing the power of generative technology in efficient code generation.
## What Will You Learn Here?

You’ll begin by exploring the core concepts and capabilities of generative AI, delving into the mechanics of large language models (LLMs) and techniques for fine-tuning them to enhance performance. You'll learn the art of prompt engineering to create effective inputs that yield better results. Additionally, you’ll investigate tools like LangChain for building AI-powered applications and examine the crucial role of vector databases in managing AI systems. You’ll discover how diffusion models generate AI images and explore the impact of AI agents and smart chatbots in driving the next wave of intelligent systems.

By the end of this course, you’ll have the knowledge and skills to experiment with AI-powered tools and understand the limitations and challenges they present.

Let’s dive in and unlock the future of creativity with generative AI!
# Unlock the Power of Generative AI

Imagine you have a creative friend who can write stories, paint pictures, and even compose music -- all based on what they've seen or heard before. This friend doesn't copy exactly what others have done; instead, they take inspiration from existing works and create something new. This is similar to generative AI.
## Overview

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content.
