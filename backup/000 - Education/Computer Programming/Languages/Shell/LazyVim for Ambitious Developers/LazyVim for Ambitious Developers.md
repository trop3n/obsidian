# Chapter 1. Introduction and Installation


This book is meant for all the developers out there who are intrigued by the power modal editing can bring, but are either intimidated or bored by the sheer amount of configuration that even introductory tutorials on the topic force upon them.

I'm guessing you're a Visual Studio Code user (a great editor that I used for a few years) but you may be coming to modal editing from numerous other integrated development environments and code editors. You've probably head of Vim and now you want to try it out.
## 1.1 Why Vim

Vim has a *very* ancient history. It was created in the early 90's as an improvement on the much older **Vi** editor, written in the 1970's. The name "Vim" actually stands for "Vi, Improved". It's predecessor, Vi, is short for "Visual", as it was an iteration on an even earlier (1971) non-visual line editing experience called `ed`.
