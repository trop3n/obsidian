# Rust Advantages

## Type Safety

- Ensures the correct usage of data in programs
- Put only toys in the "Toys" box
- Type safety helps in preventing mismatches
	- Cannot accidentally assigning a string value to an integer value
## Concurrency

- Performing multiple tasks simultaneously
- Improves program efficiency and responsiveness
- Rust provides support for concurrency using features like threads.
## No Garbage Collector

> What is a garbage collector?

- Automatic memory management that frees up unused memory.
- Allows program to run more efficiently
- Rust has no garbage collector, and uses an "ownership" system instead.
	- More efficient and predictable performance
# Why Rust?
## Performance

- Fast
- Memory Efficient
