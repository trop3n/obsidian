# Preface

This simple book is meant to get you started in programming. The title says it’s the hard way to learn to write code, but it’s actually not. It’s only the “hard” way because it uses a technique called instruction. Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition. This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more complex topics. It’s used in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills. This book instructs you in Python by slowly building and establishing skills through techniques such as practice and memorization, then applying them to increasingly difficult problems. By the end of the book you will have the tools needed to begin learning more complex programming topics. I like to tell people that my book gives you your “programming black belt.” What this means is that you know the basics well enough to now start learning programming. If you work hard, take your time, and build these skills, you will learn to code.
# The Hard Way is Easier

With the help of this book, you will do the incredibly simple things that all programmers do to learn a programming language:

1. Go through each exercise
2. Type in each file *exactly*.
3. Make it run.

That's it. This will be very difficult at first, but stick with it. If you go through this book and do each exercise for one or two hours a night, you will have a good foundation for moving on to another book about Python to continue your studies. This book won't turn you into a programmer overnight, but it will get you started on the path to learning how to code.

This book’s job is to teach you the three most essential skills that a beginning programmer needs to know: reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.
## Reading and Writing

If you have a problem typing, you will have a problem learning to code, especially if you have a problem typing the fairly odd characters in source code. Without this simple skill you will be unable to learn even the most basic things about how software works. 

Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn the names of the symbols, get familiar with typing them, and get you to read the langauge.
## Attention to Detail

The one skill that separates good programmers from bad programmers is attention to detail. In fact, it's what separates the good from the bad in any profession. You must pay attention to the tiniest details of your work or you will miss important elements of what you create. In programming, this is how you end up with bugs and difficult to use systems.
## Spotting Differences

A very important skill (that most programmers develop over time) is the ability to visually notice differences between things. An experienced programmer can take two pieces of code that are slightly different and make immediately start pointing out the differences. Programmers have invented tools to make this even easier, but we won't be using any of those.  You first have to train your brain the hard way, then use the tools. 

While you do these exercises, typing each one in, you will make mistakes. It's inevitable; even seasoned programmers would make a few. Your job is to compare what you have written to what's required to fix all the differences. By doing so, you will train yourself to **notice mistakes**, **bugs** and **other problems**.
## Ask, Don't Share

If you write code, you will write bugs. A "bug" means a defect, error, or problem with the code you've written. The legends say that this comes from an actual moth that flew into one of the first computers causing it to malfunction.  Fixing it required "de-bugging" the computer. In the world of software, there are a *lot* of bugs. So many. 

Like that first moth, your bugs will be hidden somewhere in the code, and you have to go find them. You can't just sit at your computer screen staring at the words you've written hoping that the answer jumps out at you. There is no more additional information you can get doing that, and you need additional information. You need to get up and go find the moth. 

To do that you have to **interrogate** your code and ask it what is going on or look at the problem from a different view. In this book I frequently tell you to "stop staring and ask". I show you how to make your code tell you everything it can about what's going on and how to turn this into possible solutions. I also show you how to see code in different ways, so you can get more information and insight.
## Do Not Copy-Paste

**You must *type* each of these exercises in**, manually. If you copy-paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write and see code. If you copy-paste, you are **cheating yourself** out of the effectiveness of the lessons.
## Using Included Videos

Learn Python 3 the Hard Way has an extensive set of videos demonstrating how the code works and, most importantly, how to break it. The videos are the perfect place to demonstrate many common errors by breaking the Python code on purpose and showing you how to fix it. I also walk through the code using debugging and interrogation tricks and techniques. The videos are where I show you how to “stop staring and ask” the code what’s wrong. You can watch these videos online at informit.com/title/9780134692883.
## A Note on Practice and Persistence

While you are studying programming, I'm studying how to play guitar. I practice it every day for at least two hours a day. I play scales, chords, and arpeggios for an hour and then learn music theory, ear training, songs and anything else I can. Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours because I feel like it and it's fun. To me repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn something. I know to get good at anything I have to practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it's difficult. Keep trying, and eventually it'll be easier and fun. 

Between the time that I wrote *Learn Python the Hard Way* and *Learn Ruby the Hard Way* I discovered drawing and painting. I fell in love with making visual art at the age of 39 and have been spending every day studying it in much the same way that I studied guitar, music and programming. I collected books of instructional material, did what the books said, and painted every day, and focused on **enjoying the process of learning**. I am by no means an "artist", or even that good, but now I can say that I can draw and paint. The same method I'm teaching you in this book applied to my adventures in art. If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it. 

Remember: ***everything worth doing is difficult at first***. Maybe you are the kind of person who is afraid of failure, so you give up at the first sign of difficulty. Maybe you never learned self-discipline, so you can't do anything that's "boring". Maybe you were told that you are "gifted", so you never attempt anything that might make you seen stupid or not a prodigy. 

Whatever the reason for wanting to quit, *keep at it*. Force yourself. If you run into a Study Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand, then skip it and come back later. Just keep going, because with programming there's this very odd thing that happens. At first, you will not understand anything. It'll be weird, just like with learning any human language. You will struggle with words and not know what symbols are what, and it'll all be very confusing. Then one day -- your brain will snap you will suddenly "get it". If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to understand them, you will get it. You might not be a master coder, but you will at least understand how programming works.

If you give up, you won’t ever reach this point. You will hit the first confusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep trying, keep typing it in, keep trying to understand it and reading about it, you will eventually get it. If you go through this whole book, and you still do not understand how to code, at least you gave it a shot. You can say you tried your best and a little more, and it didn’t work out, but at least you tried. You can be proud of that.

# The Setup
## Finding Things on The Internet

A major part of this book is learning to research programming topics online. I'll tell you to "search for this on the internet" and your job is to use a search engine to find the answer. The reason I have you search instead of just giving you the answer is because I want you to be an *independent* learner who *does not need the book when you're done with it*. 
## Warnings for Beginners

You are done with this exercise. This exercise might be hard depending on your familiarity with your computer. If it is difficult, take the time to read and study and get through it, because until you can do these very basic things you will find it difficult to get much programming done. 

If someone tells you to stop at a specific exercise in this book or to skip certain ones, you should ignore that person. Anyone trying to hide knowledge from you, or worse, make you get it from them instead of through your own efforts, is trying to make you depend on them for your skills. Don’t listen to them, and do the exercises anyway so that you learn how to educate yourself. A programmer will eventually tell you to use macOS or Linux. If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they’ll tell you to get a macOS computer. If he likes control and has a huge beard, he will (or ze will if you prefer non-gendered pronouns for humans with beards) tell you to install Linux. Again, use whatever computer you have right now that works. All you need is an editor, a Terminal, and Python. Finally, the purpose of this setup helps you do three things very reliably while you work on the exercises: 1. Write exercises using the text editor. 2. Run the exercises you wrote. 3. Fix them when they are broken. 4. Repeat. Anything else will only confuse you, so stick to the plan.
# Exercise 1: A Good First Program

```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun")
print('Yay! Printing')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this')
```

## Study Drills 

The Study Drills contain things you should try to do. If you can’t, skip it and come back later. For this exercise, try these things:

1. Make your script print another line.
2. Make your script print only one of the lines. 
3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does. From now on, I won’t explain how each exercise works unless an exercise is different.
# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters

Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you what something does in English, and they are used to disable parts of your program if you need to remove them temporarily. Here's how you can use comments in Python:

```python
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
```
## Study Drills

1. Find out if you were right about what the `#` character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character)
2. Take you `ex2.py` file and review each like going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse again what you should have typed. 
3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
4. Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
# Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

Every programming language has some kind of way of doing numbers and math. Do not worry: programmers frequently lie about being math geniuses when they really aren't. If they were match geniuses, they would be doing math, not writing buggy web frameworks so they can drive race cars.

This exercise has a lot of math symbols. Let's name them right away so you know what they are called. As you type this one in, say the name.

- `+`: plus
- `-`: minus
- `/`: slash
- `*`: asterisk
- `%`: percent
- `<`: less than
- `>`: greater than
- `<=`: less-than-equal
- `>=`: greater-than-equal

Notice how the operators are missing? After you type in the code for this exercise, go back and figure out what each of these does and complete the table. 

```python
print("I will now count my chickens:")

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

print("I will now count the eggs:")

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

print(3 + 2< 5 - 7)
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("what is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print("How about some more.")
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal? ", 5 >= 2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= 2)
```

```Output
I will now count my chickens:
Hens 30.0
Roosters 97
I will now count the eggs:
6.75
Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?
False
What is 3 + 2? 5
what is 5 - 7? -2
Oh, that's why it's False.
How about some more.
Is it greater? True
Is it greater or equal?  True
Is it less or equal? False
```

## Study Drills

1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started `python3.6`? Start `python3.6` this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new `.py` file that does it.
4. Rewrite `ex3.py` to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is a floating point.
# Exercise 4: Variables and Names

Now you can print things with `print` and you can do math. The next step is to learn about variables. In programming, a variable is nothing more than a **name for something**, similar to how my name, "Zed", is a name for "the human who wrote this book. " Programmers use these variable names to make their code read more like English and because they have lousy memories. If they didn't use good names for things in their software, they'd get lost when they tried to read their code again. 

If you get stuck with this exercise, remember the tricks you have been taught so far of finding differences and focusing on details:

1. Write a comment above each line explaining to yourself in English what it does.
2. Read your `.py` file backward
3. Read your `.py` file out loud, saying even the characters

```python
cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars driven

print("There are", cars "cars available ")
print("There are only", drivers, "drivers available. ")
print("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.")
print("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.")
print("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.")
print("We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.")
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Warning**: The _ in `space_in_a_car` is called an *underscore character*. Find out how to type if it if you do not already know. We use this character a lot to put an imaginary space between words with variable names.

## What you Should See

```
There are 100 cars available.
There are only 30 drivers available.
There will be 70 empty cars today.
We can transport 120.0 people today.
We have 90 to carpool today.
We need to put about 3.0 in each car.
```
## Study Drills

When this program was first written there was a mistake, and Python told us about it like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module> 
    average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger 
NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined
```

Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain why.

1. Line 1 is the traceback to the most recent system call.
2. Line two defines the file that was run, the line that caused the error, and what module was effected.
3. The code that has erroneous.
4. The type of error and an explanation of the error.
### More Study Drills

1. I used 4.0 for `space_in_a_car`, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?
	1. The code executes in the same way.
2. Remember that 4.0 is a *floating point* number. It's just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is a floating point.
3. Write comments about each of the variable assignments.
4. Make sure you know what `=` is called (equals) and that it's purpose is to give data (numbers, strings, etc.) names (`cars_driven, passengers`)
5. Remember that `_` is an underscore character.
6. Try running `python3.6` from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before, and use variable names to do you calculation. Popular variable names include `i`, `x` and `j`.
## Common Student Questions

**What is the difference between `=` and `==`?**

- The `=` single equal assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left. The `==` (double-equal) *tests whether two things have the same value*. 

**Can we write `x=100` instead of `x = 100`?**

- You can, but it's bad form. You should add space around operators like this so it's easier to read.

**What do you mean by "read the file backward"?**

- Very simple. Imagine you have a file with 16 lines of code on it. Start at line 16, and compare it to my file at line 16. Then do it again for 15, and so on until you've read the whole file backward.

**Why did you use `4.0` for `space_in_a_car`?**

It is mostly so you can then find out what a floating point number is and ask this question.

# Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing

Now we'll do even more typing of variables and printing them out. This time we'll use something called a **format string**. Every time you put " (double-quotes)  " around a piece of text you have been making a *string*. A string is how you make something that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files, send strings to web servers, among many other things.

Strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make strings that have variables embedded in them. You embed variables inside a string by using a special `{}` sequence and then put the variable you want inside of the `{}` characters.  You also must start the string with the letter `f` for "format", and in `f"Hello {somevar}"`. This little f before the (" ") and the `{}` characters tell Python, "Hey, this strings needs to be formatted. Put these variables in there."

```python
my_name = 'Jason D. Kimm'
my_age = 33 # not a lie
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 215 # pounds
my_eyes = 'Brown'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Brown'

print(f"Let's talk about {my_name}.")
print(f"He's {my_height} inches tall.")
print(f"He's {my_weight} pounds heavy.")
print(f"Actually that's not too heavy.")
print(f"He's got {my_eyes} eyes and {my_hair} hair.")
print(f"His teeth are usually {my_teeth} depending on the coffee.")

# This like is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = my_age + my_height + my_weight
print(f"If I add {my_age}, {my_height}, and {my_weight}, I get {total}.")
```
## What You Should See

```
Let's talk about Jason D. Kimm.
He's 74 inches tall.
He's 215 pounds heavy.
Actually that's not too heavy.
He's got Brown eyes and Brown hair.
His teeth are usually White depending on the coffee.
If I add 33, 74, and 215, I get 322.
```
## Study Drills

1. Change all the variables so there is not `my_` in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used `=` to set them.
2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do no just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.
### Common Student Questions

**Can I make a variable like this: `1 = 'Zed Shaw'`?**

- No, `1` is not a valid variable name. They need to start with a *character*, so a `a1` would work, but `1` would not.

**How can I round a floating point number?**

- You can use the `round()` function, like this: `rount(1.7333)`.

**Why does this not make sense to me?**

Try making the numbers in this script your measurements. It's weird, but talking about yourself will make it seem more real. Also, you're just start out so it won't make too much sense. Keep going and learn more.
# Exercise 6: Strings and Text

While you have been writing strings, you still do not know what they do. In this exercise we create a bunch of variables with complex strings so you can see what they are for. First an explanation of strings.

A **string** is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone or "export" out of the program you are writing. Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either `"` (double quotes) or `'` (single quotes) around the text. You saw this many times with the use of the `print` statement when we put the text we want to go inside the string inside the `"` or `'` after the `print` to print the string.

Strings can contain any number of variables that are in our Python script. Remember that a variable is any line of code where you set a name = (equal) to a value. In the code for this exercise, `types_of_people = 10` creates a variable named `types_of_people` and sets it equal to `10`. We can put that in any string with `{types_of_people}`. We also see that we have to use a special type of string to "format"; it's called an **f-string** and looks like this:

```python
f"some stuff here {available}"
f"some other stuff {anothervar}"
```

Python *also* has another type of formatting using the `.format()` syntax, which we see on line 17. We'll see that used sometimes when we want to apply a format to an already created string, such as in a loop. 

We will now type a whole bunch of strings, variables, and formats, and print them. We will also practice using short, abbreviated variable names. Programmers love saving time at your expense by using annoyingly short and cryptic variable names, so let's get started reading and writing them early on.

```python
types_of_people = 10
x = f"There are {types_of_people} types of people."

binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = f"Those who know {binary} and those who {do_not}."

print(x)
print(y)

print(f"I said {x}")
print(f"I also said: '{y}'")

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}"
```

```
❯ python3 ex6.py
There are 10 types of people.
Those who know binary and those who don't.
I said: There are 10 types of people.
I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'
Isn't that joke so funny?! False
This is the left side of...a string with a right side.
```
## Study Drills

1. Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? 
4. Explain why adding the two strings `w` and `e` with `+` makes a longer string.
## Break It

You are now at a point where you can try to break the code and see what happens. Think of this as a game to device the most *clever* way to break the code. You can also find the simplest way to break it. Once you break the code, you then need to fix it. 
## Common Student Questions

1. **Why do you put `'` single quotes around some strings and not others?**
	- Mostly it's because of style, but I'll use single quotes inside a string that has double quotes. 

2. **If you thought the joke was funny could you write `hilarious = true`**?
	- Yes, and we'll learn more about that in Exercise 27.
# Exercise 7: More Printing

Now we are going to do a bunch of exercises where you just type the code in and make it run. We won't be explaining this exercise because it is more of the same. The purpose is to build muscle memory. 

```python
print("Mary had a little lamb.")
print("It's fleece was white as {}.".format('snow'))
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")
print("." * 10) # What'd that do?

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch end = ' ' at the end. try removing it to see what happens
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end=' ')
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)
```

```
❯ python3 ex7.py
Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went.
..........
Cheese Burger
```

## Study Drills

For these next few exercises, we will have the exact same study drills. 

1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake it was.
4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
## Break It

Did you have fun breaking the code in Exercise 6? From now on you’re going to break all the code you write or a friend’s code. I won’t have a Break It section explicitly in every exercise, but I will do this in almost every video. Your goal is to find as many different ways to break your code until you get tired or exhaust all possibilities. In some exercises I might point out a specific common way people break that exercise’s code, but otherwise consider this a standing order to always break it.
## Common Student Questions

1. **Why are you using the variable named 'snow'?** 

	That's actually not a variable: it is just a string with the word `snow` in it. A variable wouldn't have the single-quotes around it.

2. **Is it normal to write an English comment for every line of code like you say to do?**

	No, you write comments only to explain difficult to understand code or why you did something. Why is usually much more important, and then you try to write the code so that it explains how something is being done on it's own. However, sometimes you have to write such nasty code to solve a problem that it does need a comment on every line. In this case it's *strictly for you to practice translating code into English*.

3. **Can I use single-quotes or double-quotes to make a string or do they do different things?**

	In Python either way to make a string is acceptable, although typically you'll use single-quotes for any short strings like 'a' or 'snow'
# Exercise 8: Printing, Printing

We will now see how to do more complicated formatting of a string. This code looks complex, but if you do your comments above each line and break each thing down to its parts, you'll understand it. 

```python
formatter = "{} {} {} {}"

print(formatter.format(1, 2, 3, 4))
print(formatter.format("one", "two", "three", "four"))
print(formatter.format(True, False, True, False))
print(formatter.format(formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter))
print(formatter.format(
	"Try your",
	"Own text here",
	"Maybe a poem",
	"Or a song about fear"
))
```

```
❯ python3 ex8.py
1 2 3 4
one two three four
True False True False
{} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {}
Try your Own text here Maybe a poem Or a song about fear
```

In this exercise, we're using something called a ***function*** to turn the `formatter` variable into other strings. When you see me write `formatter.format(...)`, I'm telling Python to do the following:

1. Take the `formatter` string defined on line 1.
2. Call it's `format` function, which is similar to telling it to do a command line command named `format`.
3. Pass to `format` four arguments, which match up with the four `{}`s in the `formatter variable`. This is like passing arguments to the command line command `format`.
4. The result of calling `format` on `formatter` is a new string that has the `{}` replaced with the four variables. This is what `print` is now printing.

That's a lot for the eighth exercise, so what I want you to do is consider this as a brain teaser. It's alright if you don't *really understand* what's going on because the rest of this book will slowly make this clear. At this point, try to study this and see what's going on, then move on to the next exercise.
## Study Drills

 Do your checks, write down your mistakes, and try not to make the same mistakes on the next exercise. 
## Common Questions

1. **Why do I have to put quotes around `"one"` and not around `True` or `False`?**
	`True` and `False` are recognized as keywords representing the concept of true and false. If you put quotes around them then they are turned into strings and won't work.
# Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing

By now you should realize that the pattern for this book it to use more than one exercise to teach you something new. We start with code that you might not understand, then more exercises explain the concept. Write down what you don't understand, and keep going.

```python
# Here's some new stuff, remember to type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print("Here are the days: ", days)
print("here are the months: ", months)

print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if want, or 5, or 6.
""")
```
```output
Here are the days:  Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
here are the months:  Jan
Feb
Mar
Apr
May
Jun
Jul
Aug

There's something going on here.
With the three double quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if want, or 5, or 6.
```
## Common Questions

1. **Why do I get an error when I put spaces between the three double-quotes?**
	You have to type them like `"""` and not `" " "`, meaning with *no spaces* in between them

2. **What if I wanted to start the months on a new line?**
	You simply start the string with `\n`.

3. **Is it bad that my errors are always spelling mistakes?**
	Most programming errors in the beginning are simple spelling mistakes, typos, or getting simple things out of order.
# Exercise 10: What Was That?

In Exercise 9 I threw you some new stuff, just to keep you on your toes. I showed you two ways to make a string that goes across multiple lines. In the first way, I put the characters \n (backslash n) between the names of the months. These two characters put a new line character into the string at that point. 

This \ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string. There are various escape sequences available for different characters you might want to use. We’ll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I mean.

An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote (`'`) or double-quote (`"`). Imagine you have a string that uses double quotes and you want to put a double-quote inside the string. If you write `"I understand Joe."` then Python will get confused because it will think the double quotes inside the string isn't a *real double-quote*.

To solve this problem, you *escape* double-quotes and single-quotes so Python knows to include them in the string. Here's an example:

```python
"I am 6'2\" tall."
'I am 6\'2" tall.'
```

The second way is by using triple quotes, which is just `"""` and works like a string, but you also can put as many lines of text you want until you type `"""` again.

```python
tabby_cat = "\tI'm tabbed in."
persian_cat = "I'm split\non a line."
backslash_cat = "I'm \\ a \\ cat."

fat_cat = """
I'll do a list:
\t* Cat food
\t* Fishies
\t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
"""

print(tabby_cat)
print(persian_cat)
print(backslash_cat)
print(fat_cat)
```
```Output
        I'm tabbed in.
I'm split
on a line.
I'm \ a \ cat.

I'll do a list:
        * Cat food
        * Fishies
        * Catnip
        * Grass
```
## Escape Sequences

This is all of the escape sequences Python supports. You may not use many of these, but memorize their format and what they do anyway. Try them out in some strings to see if you can make them work.

| Escape       | What it Does                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\\`         | Backslash                                                   |
| `\'`         | Single-quote                                                |
| `\"`         | Double-quote                                                |
| `\a`         | ASCII Bell (BEL)                                            |
| `\b`         | ASCII backspace (BS)                                        |
| `\f`         | ASCII formfeed (FF)                                         |
| `\n`         | ASCII linefeed (LF)                                         |
| `\N{name}`   | Character named name in the Unicode database (Unicode Only) |
| `\r`         | Carriage return (CR)                                        |
| `\t`         | Horizontal tab (TAB)                                        |
| `\uxxxx`     | Character with 16-bit hex value xxxx                        |
| `\Uxxxxxxxx` | Character with 32-bit hex value xxxxxxxx                    |
| `\v`         | ASCII vertical tab (VT)                                     |
| `\000`       | Character with octal value 000                              |
| `\xhh`       | Character with hex value hh                                 |
## Study Drills

1. Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards. 
2. Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """? 
3. Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.

## Common Questions

1. **I still haven’t completely figured out the last exercise. Should I continue?** 
	Yes, keep going. Instead of stopping, take notes listing things you don’t understand for each exercise. Periodically go through your notes and see if you can figure these things out after you’ve completed more exercises. Sometimes, though, you may need to go back a few exercises and do them again. 

2. **What makes \\ special compared to the other ones?** 
	It’s simply the way you would write out one backslash (\) character. Think about why you would need this. 

3. **When I write // or /n it doesn’t work.** 
	That’s because you are using a forward-slash (/) and not a backslash (\). They are different characters that do very different things. 

4. **I don’t get Study Drill 3. What do you mean by “combine” escape sequences and formats?**
	One concept I need you to understand is that each of these exercises can be combined to solve problems. Take what you know about format strings and write some new code that uses format strings and the escape sequences from this exercise. 

5. **What’s better, ''' or """?** 
	It’s entirely based on style. Go with the ''' (triple-single-quote) style for now, but be ready to use either depending on what feels best or what everyone else is doing.
# Exercise 11: Asking Questions

Now it's time to pick up the pace. You are doing a lot of printing to get familiar with typing simple things, but those simple things are fairly boring. What we want to do now is get data into our programs. This is a little tricky because you have to learn how to do two things that may not make sense right away.

Most of what software does is the following:

1. Takes some kind of input from a person.
2. Changes it.
3. Prints out something to show how it changed.

So far we have been printing strings, but we haven't been able to get any input from a person. We may not even know what "input" means, but type this code in anyway and make it exactly the same. In the next exercise we'll do more to explain input.

```python
print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')
weight = input()

print(f"So, you are {age} old, {height} tall, and {weight} heavy.")
```

> [!Warning]
> WARNING! We put an `end=' '` at the end of each print line. This tells print to not end the line with a newline character and go to the next line.

```Output
How old are you? 33
How tall are you? 6'3"
How much do you weigh? 195
So, you are 33 old, 6'3" tall, and 195 heavy.
```
## Study Drills

1. Go online and find out what Python's `input` does.
2. Can we find other ways to use it? 
3. Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.
## Common Student Questions

1. **How do I get a number from someone so I can do math?**
	That's a little advanced, but try `x = int(input())`, which gets the number as a string from `input()`, then converts it to an integer using `int()`. 

2. **I put my height into raw input like this `input("6'2")` but it doesn't work.**
	Don't put your height in there, type it directly into the terminal. 
# Exercise 12: Prompting People

When you typed `input()` you were typing the `(` and `)` characters, which are *parenthesis* characters. This is similar to when you used them to do a format with extra variables, as in `f{x} {y}`. For `input` you can also put in a prompt to show to a person so he knows what to type. Put a string that you want for the prompt inside the `()` so that it looks like this:

```python
y = input("Name? ")
```

This prompts the user with "Name?" and puts the result into the variable `y`. This is how you ask someone a question and get the answer. This means we can completely rewrite our previous exercise using just `input` to do all the prompting. 

```python
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
```
```
How old are you? 33
How tall are you? 6'2"
How much do you weigh? 200
So, you're 33 old, 6'2" tall and 200 heavy.
```
## Study Drills

1. In terminal, where you normally run `python3` to run your scripts, type `pydoc input`. Read what it says. 
2. Get out of `pydoc` by typing `q` to quit.
3. Look online for what the `pydoc` command does. 
4. Use `pydoc` to also read about `open`, `file` and `sys`. It's alright if you do not understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting things.
### `open`

Open file and return a stream. Raise OSError upon failure. 

File is either a **text** or **byte** string giving the name (and the path if the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed, unless `closefd` is set to `False`.)
### `os`

OS Routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on. 
### sys

This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. 
## Common Student Questions

**How come I get `SyntaxError: Invalid Syntax` whenever I run `pydoc`?**
	You aren't running Pydoc from the command line, you're probably running it from inside `python3.6`. Exit out of `python3.6` first. 

**Why does my `pydoc` not pause like yours does**? 
	Sometimes if the help document is short enough to fit on one screen then `pydoc` will just print it.

**When I run `pydoc` I get `more is not recognized as an internal`**. 
	Some versions of Windows do not have that command, which means `pydoc` is broken for you. You can skip this Study Drill and just search for Python documentation online when you need it.

**Why can't I do `print("How old are you?" , input(()`?**
	You can, but then the result of calling `input()` is never saved to a variable, and it'll work in a strange way. Try this, and then try to print out what you type. See if you can debug why this isn't working.
# Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables

In this exercise, we will cover one more input method we can use to pass variables to a script (*script is another name for .py files*). You know how you type `python3.6 ex13.py` to run the `ex13.py` file? Well the `ex13.py` part of the command is called an *argument*. What we'll do now is write a script that also accepts arguments.

Type this program and we will explain it in detail:

```python
from sys import argv
# read the WYSS section for how to run this
script, first, second, third = argv

print("The script is called", script)
print("Your first variable is:", first)
print("Your second variable is:", second)
print("Your third variable is:", third)
```

On line 1 we have what's called an `import`. This is how you add features to your script from the Python feature set. Rather than give you all the features at once, Python asks you to say what you plan to use. This keeps your programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other programmers who read your code later. 

The `argv` is the *argument variable*, a very standard name in programming that you will find used in many other languages. This variable *holds* the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it. In the exercises you will get to play with this more and see what happens. 

Line 3 *unpacks* `argv` so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variables you can work with: `script`, `first`, `second` and `third`. This may look strange, but "unpack" is probably the best word to describe what it does. It just says "Take whatever is in `argv`, go unpack it, and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order".

After that we just print them out like normal.
## Hold Up! Features Have Another Name

I call them "features" here (these little things you `import` to make your Python program do more) but nobody else calls them features. I just use that name because I needed to trick you into learning what they are without jargon. Before you can continue, you need to learn their real name: *modules*.

From now on we will be calling these "features" that we import `modules`. I'll say things like, "You want to import the `sys` module." They are also called "libraries" by other programmers, but let's just stick with modules.

> [!Warning]
>Pay attention! You have been running python scripts without command line arguments. If you type only python3.6 ex13.py you are doing it wrong! Pay close attention to how I run it. This applies any time you see argv being used.

Run the program like this (and you *must* pass *three* command line arguments):

```
$ python3.6 ex13.py first 2nd 3rd 
The script is called: ex13.py 
Your first variable is: first 
Your second variable is: 2nd 
Your third variable is: 3rd
```

This is what you should see when you do a few different runs with different arguments:

```
❯ python3 ex13.py stuff things that                      
The script is called: ex13.py
Your first variable is: stuff
Your second variable is: things
Your third variable is: that
```

```
❯ python3 ex13.py stuff things that                      
The script is called: ex13.py
Your first variable is: stuff
Your second variable is: things
Your third variable is: that
```

You can actually replace `first`, `2nd` and `3rd` with any three things you want.

If you do not run it correctly, then you will get an error like this:

```
$ python3.6 ex13.py first 2nd 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "ex13.py", line 3, in <module> 
    script, first, second, third = argv 
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)
```

This happens when you do not put enough arguments on the command when you run it (in this case just `first 2nd`). Notice that when I run it I give it `first 2nd`, which caused it to give an error about "need more than 3 values to unpack" telling you that you didn't give it enough parameters.
## Study Drills

1. Try giving it fewer than three arguments. See that error you get? See if you can explain it.
2. Write a script that has fewer arguments and one that has more. Make sure you give the unpacked variables good names.
3. Combine `input` with `argv` to make a script that gets more input from the user. Don't overthink it. Just use `argv` to get something, and `input` to get something else from the user. 
4. Remember that modules give you features. Modules. Modules. Remember this because we will need it later.
## Common Student Questions

**When I run it I get `ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack`**. 
	Remember that an important skill is paying attention to details. 

**What's the difference between `argv` and `input()`?** 
	The difference has to do with where the user is required to give input. If they give your script inputs on the command line, then you use `argv`. If you want them to input using the keyboard while the script is running, then use `input()`.

**Are the command line arguments strings?**
	Yes, they come in as strings, even if you typed numbers on the command line. Use `int()` to convert them, like with `int(input())`.

**How do you use the command line?**
	You should have learned to use it very quickly and fluently by now, but if not, read the appendix.

**I can't combine `argv` with `input()`**
	Don't overthink it. Just slap two lines at the end of this script that use the `input()` to get something and then print it. From that, start playing with more ways to use both in the same script. 

**Why can't I do this: `input('? ') = x`?** 
	Because that's backward to how it should work. Do it the way I do it and it'll work.
# Exercise 14: Prompting and Passing

Let's do one exercise that uses `argv` and `input` together to ask the user something specific. You will need this for the next exercise where you learn to read and write files. In this exercise we'll use `input` slightly differently by having it print a simple `>` prompt. This is similar to games like `Zork` or `Adventure`.

```python
from sys import argv

script, user_name = argv
prompt = '> '

print(f"Hi, {user_name}, I'm the {script} script.")
print("I'd like to ask you a few questions.")
print(f"Do you like me {user_name}?")
likes = input(prompt)

print(f"Where do you live {user_name}?")
lives = input(prompt)

print("What kind of computer do you have?")
computer = input(prompt)

print(f"""
Alright, so you said {likes} about liking me.
You live in {lives}. Not sure where that is.
And you have a {computer} computer. Nice.
""")
```

We make a variable, `prompt`, that is set to the prompt we want, and we give that to `input` instead of typing over and over. Now if we want to make the prompt something else, we just change it in this one spot and rerun the script. Very handy.

```Output
Hi, Jason, I'm the ex14.py script.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Do you like me Jason?
> Yes
Where do you live Jason?
> Texas
What kind of computer do you have?
> Custom-built

Alright, so you said Yes about liking me.
You live in Texas. Not sure where that is.
And you have a Custom-built computer. Nice.
```
## Study Drills

1. Find out what the games *Zork* and *Adventure* are. Try to find copies and play them.
2. Change the prompt variable to something else entirely. 
3. Add another argument and use it in your script, the same way you did in the previous exercise with `first`, `second = ARGV`.
4. Make sure you understand how I combined a `"""` style multiline string with the `{}` format activator in the last print.
## Common Student Questions

**I get `SyntaxError" invalid syntax` when I run this script.**
	Again, you have to run it right on the command line, not inside Python. 

**I don't understand what you mean by changing the prompt?**
	See the variable `prompt = '> '`. Change that to a different value. You know this, it's just a string and you've done 13 exercises making them, so take the time to figure it out.

**I get the error `ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack`**. Remember when I said you need to look at the *What You Should See* section and replicate what I did? We need to do the same thing here. 

**I get NameError: name 'prompt' is not defined when I run it.** 
	You either spelled the name of the prompt variable wrong or forgot that line. Go back and compare each line of code to mine, starting at the bottom of the script and working up to the top. Any time you see this error, it means you spelled something wrong or forgot to create the variable
# Exercise 15: Reading Files

You know how to get input from a user with `input` or `argv`. Now you will learn about reading from a file. You may have to play with this exercise the most to understand what's going on, so do the exercise carefully and remember your checks. Working with files is an easy way to *erase your work* if you are not careful.

This exercise involves writing two files. One is the usual `ex15.py` file that you will run, but the *other* is named `ex15_sample.txt`. This second file isn't a script but a plaintext file we'll be reading in our script. Here are the contents of the file:

```
This is stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
```

What we want to do is *open* the file in our script and print it out. However, we do not want to just *hard code* the name `ex15_sample.txt` into our script. "Hard Coding" means putting some bit of information that should come from the user as a string directly in the source code. That's bad because we want it to load other files later. The solution is to use `argv` or `input` to ask the user what file to open instead of hard coding the file's name.

```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

txt = open(filename)

print(f"Here's your file {filename}:")
print(txt.read())

print("Type the filename again:")
file_again = input("> ")

txt_again = open(file_again)

print(txt_again.read())
```

A few fancy things are going on in this file, so let's break it down really quickly:

- Lines 1-3 use `argv` to get a filename. Next we have line 5, where we use a new command, `open`. Right now, run `pydoc open` and read the instructions. Notice how, like your own scripts and `input`, it takes a parameter and returns a value you can set to your own variable. You just opened a file. 
- Line 7 prints a little message, but on line 8 we have something very new and exciting. We call a function on `txt` named `read`. What you get back from `open` if a `file`, and it also has commands you can give it. You give a file a command by using the `.`  (dot or period), the name of the command, and parameters, just like with `open` and `input`. The difference is that `txt.read()` says, "Hey txt! Do your read command with no parameters!"

The remainder of the file is more of the same, but we'll leave the analysis to you in the Study Drills.

```output
~/Dev/python/python-learning/thehardway on  main [✘] via 🐍 v3.12.7 ❯ python3 ex15.py ex15_sample.txt
Here's your file ex15_sample.txt:
This is stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
Type the filename again:
> ex15_sample.txt
This is stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
```
## Study Drills

This is a big jump, so be sure you do this Study Drill as best you can before moving on.

1. Above each line, comment out in English what that line does. 
2. If you are not sure, ask someone for help or search online. Many times search for "python THING" will find answers to wha that THING does in Python. 
3. I used the word "commands" here, but commands are also called "functions" and "methods". We will learn about functions and methods later in the book.
4. Get rid of line 10-15 where you use `input` and run the script again.
5. Use only `input` and try the script the same way. Why is one way of getting the filename better than another?
6. Start `python3.12` to start the `python3.12` shell, and use `open` from the prompt just like in this program. Notice how you can open files and run `read` on them from within `python3.12`.
7. Have your script also call `close()` on the `txt` and `txt_again` variables. It's important to close files when you are done with them.
## Common Student Questions

> **Does `txt = open(filename)` return the contents of the file?**
	No, it doesn't. It actually makes something called a *file object*. You can think of a file like an old tape drive that you saw on mainframe computers in the 1950's or even like a DVD player from today. You can mov around inside them and then "read" them, but the DVD player is not the DVD the same way the file object is not the file's contents.

> **Why is there not error when we open the file twice?**
	Python will not restrict you from opening a file more than once, and sometimes this is necessary.

> **What does `from sys import argv` mean?**
	For now just understand that `sys` is a package, and this phrase just says to get the `argv` feature from that package. You'll learn more about these later.

> **I put the name of the file in as `script, ex15_sample.txt = argv`, but it doesn't work.**
	No, that's not how to do it. Make the code exactly like it is in the book, then run it from the command line the same way as the book.
# Exercise 16: Reading and Writing Files

If you did the study drills from the last exercise, you should have seen all sorts of methods/functions you can give to files. Here's the list of commands I want you to remember:

- `close`: Closes the file. Like `File -> Save...` in your editor.
- `read`: Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
- `readLine`: Reads just one line of a text file.
- `truncate`: Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file. 
- `write('stuff')`: Writes 'stuff' to the file.
- `seek(0)`: moves the read/write location to the beginning of the file.

One way to remember what each of these does is to think of a vinyl record, cassette tape, VHS tape, DVD or CD player. In the early days of computers, data was stored on each of these kinds of media, so many of the file operations still resemble a storage system that is linear. Tape and DVD drives need to "seek" a specific spot, and then you can read or write at that spot. Today we have operating systems and storage media that blur the lines between random access memory and disk drives, but we still use the older idea of a linear tape with a read/write head that must be moved.

For now, these are the important commands you need to know. Some of them take parameters, but we do not really care about that. You only need to remember that `write` takes a parameter of a string you want to write to the file.

Let's use some of this to make a simple little text editor:

```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print(f"We're going to erase {filename}.")
print("If you don't want to do that, hit CTRL-C (^C).")
print("If you do want that, hit RETURN.")

input("?")

print("Opening the file...")
target = open(filename, 'w')

print("Truncating the file. Goodbye!")
target.truncate()

print("Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.")

line1 = input("line 1: ")
line2 = input("line 2: ")
line3 = input("line 3: ")

print("I'm going to write these to the file.")

target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print("And finally, we close it.")
target.close()
```

That's a large file, probably the largest you have typed in. So go slow, do your checks, and make it run. One trick is to get bits of it running at a time. Get lines 1-8 running, then five more, then a few more, until it's all done and running.

```
We're going to erase test.txt.
If you don't want to do that, hit CTRL-C (^C).
If you do want that, hit RETURN.
?
Opening the file...
Truncating the file. Goodbye!
Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.
line 1: NixOS is really cool.
line 2: But it's very hard to learn.   
line 3: Easy stuff becomes a chore. But I won't give up.
I'm going to write these to the file.
And finally, we close it.
```

Now, open up the file you made in your editor and check it out. Neat, right?
## Study Drills

1. If you do not understand this, go back through and use the comment rick to get it squared away in your mind. One simple English comment above each line will help you understand or at least let you know what you need to research more. 
2. Write a script similar to the least exercise that uses `read` and `argv` to read the file you just created.
3. There's too much repetition in this file. Use strings, formats, and escapes to print out `line1`, `line2` and `line3` with just one `target.write()` command instead of six. 
4. Find out why we had to pass a `'w'` as an extra parameter to `open`. Hint: `open` tries to be safe by making you explicitly say you want to write a file.
5. If you open the file with `'w'` mode, then do you really need the `target.truncate()`? Read the documentation for Python's open function and see if that's true.
# More Files

Now let's do a few more things with files. We'll write a Python script to copy one file to another. It'll be very short but will give you ideas about other things you can do with files. 

```python
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print(f"Copying from {from_file} to {to_file}")

# we could do these two on one line, how?
in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()

print(f"The input file is {len(indata)} bytes long")

print(f"Does the output file exist? {exists(to_file)}")
print("Ready, fit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort.")
input()

out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
out_file.write(indata)

print("Alright, all done.")

out_file.close()
in_file.close()
```

You should immediately notice that we `import` another handy command named `exists`. This returns `True` if a file exists, based on its name in a string as an argument. It returns `False` if not. We'll be using this function in the second half of this book to do a lot of things, but right now we should see how we can import it. 

Using `import` in this way to get tons of free code other better programmers have written so you do not have to write it.

```
❯  python3 ex17.py test.txt new_file.txt
Copying from test.txt to new_file.txt
The input file is 21 bytes long
Does the output file exist? False
Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort.

Alright, all done.
```

It should work with any file. Try a bunch more and see what happens. Just be careful not to blast an important file. 

> [!Warning]
> WARNING! Did you see the trick I did with echo to make a file and cat to show the file? You can learn how to do that in the Appendix, “Command Line Crash Course.”

## Study Drills

1. This script is *really* annoying. There's no need to ask you before doing the copy, and it prints too much out to the screen. Try to make the script more friendly to use by removing features. 
2. See how short you can make the script. I could make this one line long.
3. Notice at the end of the *What You Should See* section I used something called `cat`? It's and old command that concatenates files together, but mostly it's just an easy way to print a file to the screen. 
4. Find out why you had to write `out_file.close()` in the code. 
5. Go read up on Python's `import` statement, and start `python3.12` to try it out. Try importing some things and see if you can get it right. 
## Common Student Questions

> **Why is the `'w'` in quotes?**
> 	That's a string. You've been using strings for a while now. 

> **No way you can make this one line!**
> 	That ; depends ; on ; how ; you ; define ; one ; line ; of ; code.

> **Is it normal to feel like this exercise was really hard?**
> 	Yes, it's totally normal. Programming may not "click" for you until maybe even exercise 36, or it might not until you finish the book and then make something with Python.

> **What does the `len()` function do?**
> 	It gets the length of the string that you pass to it then returns that as a number.

> **When I try to make this script shorter I get an error when I close the files at the end.**
> 	You probably did something like `indata = open(from_file).read()`, which means you don't need to then do `in_file.close()` when you reach the end of the script. It should already be closed by Python once the script runs.
# Exercise 18: Names, Variables, Code, Functions

Big title, right? We are about to learn about functions. Every programmer will go on and on about functions and all the different ideas about how they work and what they do, but I will give the simplest explanation you can use right now.

Functions do three things:

1. They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.
2. They take arguments the way your script takes `argv`.
3. Using 1 and 2, they let you make your own "mini-scripts" or "tiny commands".

You can create a function using the word `def` in Python. I'm going to have you make four different functions that work like your scripts, and then show how each one is related. 

```python
# this one is like your scripts with argv
def print_two(*args):
	arg1, arg2 = args
	print(f"arg1: {arg1}, arg2: {arg2}")

# ok, that *args is actually pointless, we can just do this
def print_two_again(arg1, arg2):
	print(f"arg1: {arg1}, arg2: {arg2}")

# this just takes one argument
def print_one(arg1):
	print(f"arg1: {arg1}")

# this one takes no arguments
def print_none():
	print("I got nothin'.")

print_two("Jason", "Kimm")
print_two_again("Jason", "Kimm")
print_one("First!")
print_none()
```

Let's break down the first function, `print_two`, which is the most similar to what you already know from making scripts:

1. We tell Python we ant to make a function using `def`.
2. One the same line as `def` we give the function a name. Function names should, generally, say what the function does.
3. We tell it we want `*args`, which is a lot like the `argv` parameter but for functions. This *has* to go inside the parenthesis.
4. We end this line with a `:` and start indenting.
5. After the colon, all the lines that are indented four spaces will become attached to `print_two`. Our first indented line is one that *unpacks the arguments*, the same as with the scripts. 
6. To demonstrate how it woks, we print these arguments out, just like we would in a script. 

The problem with `print_two` is that it's not the easiest way to make a function. In Python we can skip the whole unpacking arguments and just use the names we want right inside the parenthesis. That's what `print_two_again` does.

After that you have an example of how to make a function that takes one argument in `print_one`.

Finally you have a function that has no arguments in `print_none`.

```
❯  python3
 ex18.py
arg1: Jason, arg2: Kimm
arg1: Jason, arg2: Kimm
arg1: First!
I got nothin'.
```

Right away you can see how a function works. Notice that you used your functions the way you use things like `exists`, `open` and other commands. In fact, you've been tricked into this because in Python those commands are just functions. This means you can make your own commands and use them in your scripts, too.
## Study Drills

Create a `function checklist` for later exercises. Write these checks on an index card and keep it by you while you complete the rest of these exercises or until you feel you do not need the index card anymore. 

1. Did you start your function definition with def? 
2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters? 
3. Did you put an open parenthesis right after the function name? 
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis separated by commas? 
5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)? 
6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments? 
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less. 
8. Did you “end” your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting, we call it)?

When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing it's name?
2. Did you put the `(` character after the name to run it?
3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
4. Did you end the function call with a `)` character?

Use these two checklists on the remaining lessons until you do not need them anymore. 

Finally, repeat this a few times to yourself. 
## Common Student Questions

> [!Question]
> What's allowed in a function name?

The same as variable names. Anything that doesn't start with a number and is letters, numbers and underscores will work.

> [!Question]
> What does the `*` in `*args` do?

That tells Python to take all the arguments to the function and then put them in `args` as a list. It's like `argv` that you've been used to but *for functions*. It's not normally used too often unless specifically needed.

>[!question]
>This feels really boring and monotonous.

That's good. It means you're starting to get better at typing in the code and understanding what it does. To make it less boring, take everything I tell you to type in, and then break it on purpose. 
# Exercise 19: Functions and Variables

Functions may have been a mindblowing amount of information, but do not worry. Just keep doing these exercises and going through your checklist from the last exercise and you will eventually get it.

There is one tiny point that you might not have realized, which we'll reinforce right now. The variables in your function are not connected to the variables in your script. Here's an exercise to get you thinking about this:

```python
def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
	print(f"You have {cheese_count} cheeses!")
	print(f"You have {boxes_of_crackers} boxes of crackers!")
	print("Man that's enough for a party!")
	print("Get a blanket.\n")

print("We can just give the function numbers directly:")
cheese_and_crackers(20, 30)

print("OR, we can use variables in our script:")
amount_of_cheese = 10
amount_of_crackers = 50

cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese, amount_of_crackers)

print("We can even do math inside too:")
cheese_and_crackers(10 + 20, 5 + 6)

print("And we can combine the two, variables and math:")
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese + 100, amount_of_crackers + 1000)
```

This shows all the different ways we're able to give our function `cheese_and_crackers` the values it needs to print them. We can give it straight numbers. We can give it variables. We can give it math. We can even combine math and variables.

In a way, the arguments to a function are kind of like our = character when we make a variable. In fact, if you can use `=` to name something, you can usually pass it to a function as an argument.
## What You Should See

You should study the output of this script and compare it with what you think you should get for each of the examples in the script.

```fish
❯  python3 ex19.py  nix-shell-env 
We can just give the function numbers directly:
You have 20 cheeses!
You have 30 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.

OR, we can use variables in our script:
You have 10 cheeses!
You have 50 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.

We can even do math inside too:
You have 30 cheeses!
You have 11 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.

And we can combine the two, variables and math:
You have 110 cheeses!
You have 1050 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.
```
## Study Drills

1. Go back through the script and type a comment above each line explaining in English what it does. 
2. Start at the bottom and read each line backward, saying all the important characters. 
3. Write at least one more function of your own design, and run it 10 different ways.
