## Python Modules for Automation

Here are some modules that are very useful for automation:

### 1. PyAutoGUI

PyAutoGUI is a Python library that allows you to automate tasks by controlling the mouse and keyboard. It's a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks, creating macros, and even testing GUI applications.

- [PyAutoGUI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/python-pyautogui/)
### 2. Selenium

Selenium is a powerful tool for automating interactions with web applications. It allows us to script actions that a user would typically perform on a website, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating through web pages.

- [Selenium](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/browser-automation-using-selenium/)
### 3. Requests

Automation using the `requests` library in Python is typically used for making HTTP requests to interact with web services, APIs, or websites programmatically. You can send various types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Once you send a request, you cna handle the response, which includes the status code, headers, and content.

- [Requests](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-requests-tutorial/)
### 4. BeautfiulSoup

Automation using BeautifulSoup is typically used for web scraping tasks. BeautifulSoup is a Python library that makes it easy to extract data from HTML and XML documents. We can use BeautifulSoup's methods to locate and extract specific elements from the HTML document.

-  [BeautifulSoup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/) 
### 5. Pandas

Automation using pandas typically involves automating tasks related to data manipulation, analysis, and processing. Once the data is obtained we want to automate tasks on it.

The data can come from various sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, databases, web APIs, or web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup. We can use pandas to conduct data analysis, including summary statistics, grouping, aggregation, and visualization.

- [Pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-tutorial/)

## How to Automate a Task? 

Automating a task might look very complex, but if you know the basics of Python and you follow these steps, you can easily create an automation script.
### Step 1: Identify the Task

Before writing the code, you should have it clear what you want your code to do. So having a clear picture of what the task is, will help you in finishing it. 
### Step 2: Divide the Task into Smaller Steps

Now break down the desired task into smaller tasks and achieve the initial goal. After achieving the initial goal you can then go to the next one. Breaking the main goal into smaller goals helps you in solving one problem at a time. 
### 3: Research Python Libraries

Now you need to find optimal Python libraries that are most suitable for the task. Using the right libraries will increase efficieny and decrease time consumption.
### Step 4: Write the Code

Now you just need to write the Python script, that can automate your desired tasks. Use the right libraries and functions to make writing easier.
### Step 5: Test the Code

After you have completed the writing part, test your code on different instances and variations. Testing your code will help you in finding issues with your code. It also helps in building confidence in the results.
### Step 6: Update the Code

If your code is not working properly or there are some instances of wrong results, you can update your code and make corrections. In cases where you might want to add additional features to your code, you can do it in this step.
## Python Automation Examples

Let's look at one **simple example of automation**. In this example, we are automating the task of creating a file and writing text in it. 

```python
# define the file name
file_name = &quot;automated_file.txt&quot;

# define the text to write
text = &quot;Hello! This is an automated file with text.&quot;

# open the file in write mode (this will create the file if it doens't exist)
with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
	file.write(text)

print(f&quot;File '{file_name}' has been created and the message has been written.&quot;)
```

```output
File 'automated_file.txt' has been created and the message has been written.
```

After executing this code, you will find the file with text at the same location/directory as your Python file.

## Automating Workflows with Python Scripts

Let's look at some workflows that can be automated using Python scripts. We will also cover some examples of each workflow to understand the work. 

### 1. Web Scraping

Web scraping is a technique to fetch data from websites. While surfing on the web, many websites don't allow the user to save data for personal use.

One way is to manually copy-paste the data, which is both tedious and time-consuming. Web Scraping is the automation of the data extraction process from websites. This event is done with the help of web scraping software known as ***web scrapers***. 

They automatically load and extract data from the websites based on user requirements. These can be custom-built to work for one site or can be configured to work with any website.
#### Some examples of Web Scraping:

2. [Scraping Reddit with Python and BeautifulSoup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scraping-reddit-with-python-and-beautifulsoup/)
3. [Scraping Covid-19 statistics using BeautifulSoup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scraping-covid-19-statistics-using-beautifulsoup/)

5. [Scrape IMDB movie rating and details using Python and saving the details of top movies to .csv file](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scrape-imdb-movie-rating-and-details-using-python/)
### 2. GUI Automation

GUI (graphical user interface) automation is the process of automating interactions with graphical elements in the user interface of a software application or system.

GUI automation involves simulating user actions, such as clicking buttons, filling our forms, navigating menus, and interacting with windows, to perform tasks or test without manual intervention.

GUI automation is commonly used in software testing, repetitive task automation, and robotic process automation (RPA).

Some examples of GUI automation:

1. [GUI Automation using Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gui-automation-using-python/)
2. [Mouse and keyboard automation using Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mouse-keyboard-automation-using-python/)
### 3. Software Testing Automation

Software testing is the process in which a developer ensures that the actual output of the software matches the desired output by providing some test inputs to the software. 

Software testing cna be divided into two classes: **Manual Testing and Automated Testing**. 

- Automated Testing is the execution of your tests using a script instead of a human. 

Here we'll discuss some of the methods of automated software testing with Python.

Some examples of Test Automation:

1. [Automated software testing with Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/automated-software-testing-with-python/)
2. [Automated Browser Testing with Edge and Selenium in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/automated-browser-testing-with-edge-and-selenium-in-python/)
### 4. API Automation

API automation, often referred toa s API testing or automated API testing, is the practice of using automation tools and scripts to test and validate the functionality of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Some examples of API automation:

- [Track Covid-19 Vaccine Slots using cowin in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/track-covid-19-vaccine-slots-using-cowin-in-python/)
### 5. Robotic Process Automation

Robotics Process Automation (RPA) is a useful and widely emerging technology in the business world nowadays. RPA is based on machine learning and artificial intelligence which uses various software robots to perform business-oriented tasks. 

Previously, in many organizations, the large volume of data was handled by the humans themselves. But with the use of RPA, all the maintenance of data can be done easily with the help of a few software, and no manual or human interference is needed. 

Some example of Robotic Process Automation:

- [Robotic Process Automation (RPA) – Email Automation using UIPath](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/robotic-process-automation-rpa-email-automation-using-uipath/)
