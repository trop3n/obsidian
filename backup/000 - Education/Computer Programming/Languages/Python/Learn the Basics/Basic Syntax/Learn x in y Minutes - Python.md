Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990's. It is now one of the most popular languages in existence. 

```python

""" Multiline strings can be written
    using three "s, and are often used 
    as documentation.

# -------- Primitive Datatypes and Operators ----------- # 

# You have numbers
3 # => 3

# Math is what you would expect
1 + 1     # => 2
8 - 1     # => 7
10 * 2    # => 20
35 / 5    # => 7.0

# Floor division rounds towards negative infinity
5 // 3       # => 1
-5 // 3      # => -2
5.0 // 3.0   # => 1.0 # works on floats to
-5.0 // 3.0  # => -2.0

# The results of division is always a float
10.0 / 3     # => 3.33333333333333335

# Modulo Operation
7 % 3        # => 1
# i % j have the same sign as j, unlike C
-7 % 3       # => 2

# exponentiation (x ** y, x to the yth power)
2**3         # => 8

# Enforce precedence with parenthesis
1 + 3 * 2    # => 7
(1 + 3) * 2  # => 8

# Boolean values are primitives
True         # => True
False        # => False

# negate with not
not True     # => False
not False    # => True

# Boolean Operators
# Note "and" and "or" are case-sensitive
True and False # => False
False or True  # => True

# True and False are actually 1 and 0 but with different keywords
True + True    # => 2
True * 8       # => 8
False - 5      # => -5

# Comparison operators look at the numerical value of True and False
0 == True      # => True
2 > True       # => True
2 == True      # => False
-5 != False    # => True

# None, 0, and empty strings/lists/dicts/types/sets all evaluate to false.
# All other values are True.
bool(0)        # => False
bool("")       # => False
bool([])       # => False
bool({})       # => False
bool(())       # => False
bool(set())    # => False
bool(4)        # => True
bool(-6)       # => True

# Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation,
# but their non-cast value is returned. Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise
# and/or (&, |)
bool(0)        # => False
bool(2)        # => True
0 and 2        # => 0
bool(-5)       # => True
bool(2)        # => True
-5 or 0        # => -5

# Equality is ==
1 == 1         # => True
2 == 1         # => False

# Inequality is !=
1 != 1         # => False
2 != 1         # => True

# More comparisons
1 < 10         # => True
1 > 10         # => False
2 <= 2         # => True
2 >= 2         # => True

# Seeing whether a value is in a range
1 < 2 and 2 < 3  # => True
2 < 3 and 3 > 2  # => False
# Chaining makes this look nicer
1 < 2 < 3        # => True
2 < 3 < 2        # => False

# (is vs. ==) is checks if two variables refer to the same object, but == checks
# if the objects pointed to have the same values.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] # Point a at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = a            # Point b at what a is pointing to 
b is a           # => True, a and b refer to the same object
b == a           # => True, a's and b's objects are equal
b = [1, 2, 3, 4] # Point b at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b is a           # => False, a and b do not refer to the same object
b == a           # => True, a's and b's objects are equal

# Strings are created with "" or ''
"This is a string"
'This is also a string'

# Strings can be added to 
"Hello " + "world!"  # => "Hello world!"
# String literals (but not variables) can be concatenated without using '+'
"Hello " "world!" # => "Hello world!"

# A string can be treated like a list of characters
"Hello world!"[0]    # => 'H'

# You can find the length of a string
len("This is a string")  # => 16

# Since Python 3.6, you can use f-strings or formatted string literals.
name = "Reiko"
f"She said her name is {name}."   # => "She said her name is Reiko"
# Any valid Python expression inside these braces is returned to the string.
f"{name} is {len(name)} characters long." # => "Reiko is 5 characters long."

# None is an object
None # => None

# Don't use the equality "==" symbol to compare objects to None
# Use "is" instead. This checks for equality of object identity.
"etc" is None    # => False
None is None     # => True
