# Dive Right In

### Let Art Meet Computing

> An artist only needs a drawing board, some colors, and a little bit of creative imagination.

Let's create a drawing board with only one line of Python code:

```python
board.draw()
```

Now that we have a board, let's add some colors to it:

```python
board.draw()
board.color(1 ,1 ,"red")
board.color(1 ,9 ,"black")
```

The third line of code, `board.color(1, 9, "black")`, 1 represents the row number, and 9 represents the column number, which needs to be colored black.

The complete code draws two squares on the board. One square is red, and the other is black. We can surely add another.

Let’s say we want to draw another square, this time on the 9th row and 9th column, and we want it to be in green color. We know you guessed it already; we’d have to add another line of Python code. Why don’t we add `board.color(9, 9, "green")` in the code widget below?

```python
board.draw()
board.color(1, 1, "red")
board.color(1, 9, "black")
board.color(9, 9, "green")
```
### A Smiley Emoji

> If we know how to draw one little square, eventually, we can draw anything on this 9 × 9 drawing board. How about the following smiley emoji?

```python
board.draw()
board.color(2, 7, "black")
board.color(5, 2, "black")
board.color(6, 3, "black")
board.color(7, 4, "black")
board.color(7, 6, "black")
board.color(6, 7, "black")
board.color(5, 8, "black")
```

> The computer is a very efficient machine. Nevertheless, it is the coder's job to use the right language and the right instructions to make them do something useful or creative for us. THat is why we learn how to code.
# Data Analysis

> Jay Baer, a marketing expert, rightly exclaimed:

`We are surrounded by data, but starved for insights.`

Data Science is the skill of the 21st century *that takes raw data and, through coding, brings forth insights to help answer an interesting question or query.*
### Plotting Data

For instance, here's an interesting question. Which programming language is the most popular in the world at the moment? One way to answer this question is to consider the language that you have personally heard of as the most popular in the whole world. 

The data science way to settling the question is to look for trustworthy data from a credible source and then represent the raw data visually. Run the code once to see the pie chart plotted on the screen.

> It can be seen that the pie chart gives a slightly different view of the same data than the bar chart. The pie chart lets us see the relative proportion of each programming language's slice in the entire pie.
### Race Plot

Some people may argue that these kinds of plots have been around ever since there were spreadsheet applications. That's a fair enough remark. 

Speaking of data scientists bringing forth insight, how about running the following piece of code?

- This is no longer a static shot of the data. This generates a journey of programming languages as they go from being the most popular to being not-so-popular over the years. 
- Keep an eye out for the journey of Python as it rises up the ranks.

The code generates a horizontal bar chart illustrating language popularity with labels indicating the most favored languages. As the code progresses through each frame, it dynamically adjusts the chart’s display to fit the changing popularity levels. 

The resulting frames provide a visual depiction of how programming language preferences evolve over the specified time period.

> We wanted to establish that there are things we can do with coding that are impossible to imagine using just spreadsheet software applications. 
# Artificial Intelligence

> Find out if we can code to make machines learn and become intelligent.
### Bringing Color to Our Ancestry

> In the hundreds of years of photography's history and its development, bringing color to pictures is a relatively recent phenomenon. It is strange to hear of this, given how surrounded we are with pictures and all sorts of instant filters now. 

But it is no surprise that almost every household still has pictures of their loved ones or some nostalgic memories still preserved in the form of black and white images. 

Paul Outerbridge, a professional photographer, rightly pointed out:

> One very important difference between monochromatic and color photography is this: in black and white, you suggest; in color, you state.
### Using AI to Colorize Images

> While it required a lot of manual labor and extreme human ingenuity to bring color to old vintage black and white pictures, today, machine learning models can be trained to do what humans intelligently did.

The code utilizes machine learning to add color information to an image. It first prepares the image for processing and then employs a machine learning algorithm to determine color details. After integrating the color data with the original image, it converts the result back to a familiar color format.

### The Aftertaste:

> Computer science has come a long way from it's early years, where a machine only does what a human coder asks it to do. Today, we can write code that teaches the machine to do something that only human intelligence could have done earlier. However, to make the machines behave intelligently, we would need to do this in a programming language.

Python is a perfect language to learn, if we want to make machines intelligent.

## Problem-solving is fundamental in coding. A coder always has a handful of valid coding instructions, but the entire creative challenge is to be able to solve the problem at hand using the limited set of instructions. This involves arranging the available instructions in the correct sequence.

## Before this lesson, we knew how to write sequential code and `while` loops that repeatedly execute some lines of code. In this lesson, we’ve learned the power of the `if`-`else` conditional and how it can change the execution of the code based on a condition. *The combination of sequential, repetitive, and conditional branching* gives us a lot of problem-solving power as coders.
