An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. In short its an interface between computer hardware and user. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. 

An operating system is software that manages computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system. A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.

Concerned with the assignment of resources among programs e.g. memory, processes, devices and information routines. Similarly, the operating system has programs to carry out these tasks as a traffic controller, scheduler, [memory management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/) module I/O program and file system.
## History of Operating System

The operating system has been evolving through the years. The following table shows the history of OS.

|Generation|Year|Electronic device used|Types of OS Devices|
|---|---|---|---|
|First|1945-55|Vacuum Tubes|Plug Boards|
|Second|1955-65|Transistors|Batch Systems|
|Third|1965-80|Integrated Circuits(IC)|Multiprogramming|
|Fourth|Since 1980|Large Scale Integration|PC|
## Characteristics of Operating Systems

Let us now discuss some of the important characteristic features of operating systems:

- **Device Management**: The operating system keeps track of all the devices. So, it is also called the [Input/Output controller](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/i-o-scheduling-in-operating-systems/) that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.
- **File Management**: It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also decides who gets the resource.
- **Job Accounting**: It keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs or users.
- **Error-detecting Aids**: These contain methods that include the production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.
- **Memory Management**: It is responsible for managing the [primary memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/primary-memory/) of a computer, including what part of it are in use by whom also check how much amount free or used and allocate processes.
- **Processor Management**: It allocates the processor to a process and then de-allocates the processor when it si no longer required or the job is done.
- **Control on System Performance**: It records the delays between the request for a service and the system.
- **Security**: It prevents unauthorized access to programs and data using passwords or some kind of protection technique.
- **Convenience**: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
- **Efficiency**: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used efficiently.
- **Ability to Evolve**: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.
- **Throughput**: An OS should be constructed so that it can give maximum throughput (number of tasks per unit theme).
