# What is a Computer?

Nowadays, we are introduced to computers at a very early age. Whether it is for playing games on a smartphone or listening to music on a sound system, we're surrounded by computer technology. But how can the same computer display such a variety of information and formats. Let's get started and find out.

## Computer Basics

A **computer** is a machine that manipulates information to assist humans with different sorts of computations, including, but not limited to adding two numbers, online shopping, and building virtual reality systems.

A machine that provides such diverse functionalities might be challenging to comprehend at first, right? But any computer system can be built with only four basic functionalities, shown in the figure below. 

- **Input**: A device that can capture the information from the real world such as a keyboard, a mouse, a microphone, or even a heart rate monitor.
- **Storage**: A physical space that can store the information from the input device.
- **Processor**: An electronic circuit that can process the information stored in storage.
- **Output**: A device that displays the processed information, e.g. a monitor, a printer or a speaker.

# A Brief History of Computations

Learn a brief history of computation machines.

## History of Computation Tools

In the past, when the scale of computation was limited, humans would perform calculations manually. It would take them some time to even count up to a few hundred. But as the computations got more complex, humans started using tools that would perform complex calculations and store their results.

### The Abacus

One of the earliest computation tools is the abacus. It served as an essential counting tool that also stored the resulting count. It was made up of wooden beads that could be moved to the right or left to increment or decrement the count.

A working demonstration of an abacus is shown below. It can store a count of up to 9999. The yellow beads increment units, the green beads increment tens, the blue beads increment hundreds, and the red beads increment thousands. So, to count 2341, you’ll have to move two red beads, three blue beads, four green beads, and one yellow bead to the right.

### The Pascaline and Leibniz Wheel

In 1642, the abacus evolved into the first mechanical calculator, the Pascaline, created by Blaise Pascal. It was only able to add and subtract numbers by manipulating its dials. 

To improve the Pascaline, a German mathematician named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented a digital mechanical calculator called the Leibniz wheel in 1694. Based on the binary number system, it was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations.

### The First Computer

Charles Babbage is referred to as the "father of the computer" because he conceptualized and invented the first general purpose programmable computing engine in the early 19th century. In 1822, Babbage began his work on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigation calculations. In 1833, he came up with the idea of a much more general design.

Thus began his work on a more advanced machine called the **Analytical Engine**. It was the first general-purpose computing machine, while the previous machines were all made for very specific computing tasks. This machine could be programmed through a series of hole-punched cards and used several techniques that are still used in modern computing, such as the arithmetic logic unit, control flow, and integrated memory.

# Hardware and Software

Learn about essential components of computers, computer programs, and their uses.

Two main components are required for any modern digital general-purpose computing machine: hardware and software.

## Hardware

**Hardware** is the set of physical components that make up a computer system. These components typically include the central processing unit, motherboard, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices.

**CPU**: The computer's brain, which performs all the processing tasks.

**Motherboard**: The main circuit board, which connects all the components of a computer.

**Memory**: The temporary storage space that holds data and instructions while the computer runs. 

**Storage Devices**: Hard disk drives and solid-state drives that store data.

**Bus**: Connects the CPU to other components on the motherboard. The bus allows for internal communication between the CPU and memory, cache, and other components.

**Input/Output Devices**: The mouse, monitors, keyboards, printers, and scanners that allow users to interact with the computer.

## Software

**Software** refers to the set of computer programs, data and instructions that tell a computer what to do. It's an *intangible component* of a computer system that instructs the hardware to perform specific tasks. Software can be developed using different programming languages. Without software, a computer would be mothing more than a collection of hardware components without the ability to function. 

A (simple) calculator is a fixed-purpose computing machine. It only does what it was created to do. However, our smartphones and laptops, for example, can be used for many different purposes. This is thanks to the software part, which runs on top of the hardware. Each computer program is built to solve a certain problem.

### Computer Program

A **computer program** is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. It can be designed to perform a vast range of tasks, from basic arithmetic calculations to complex data processing. Computer programs are used in various areas, such as word processing, data analysis, gaming, web browsing, etc. The concept of a computer program involves both data and processing.

### Data

**Data** refers to the input that the program takes in, which can include various types of information such as text, numbers, images or sound.

### Processing

**Processing** involves the instructions that the program uses to transform the input data into an output result. This can include simple operations like adding or subtracting numbers or more complex operations like sorting, searching for, or analyzing large amounts of data.

## Everyday Application of Computers

> Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives. The following are common uses of computers:

### Communication

Computers are used for communication through social media, email, instant messaging, and other means.

### Entertainment

Computers are used for entertainment purposes, such as gaming, music and video production, and streaming media.

### Education

Computers are used in education to facilitate learning, research, and collaboration. They are used in classrooms, libraries and online learning environments.

### Business

Computers are used in businesses for a variety of purposes, including accounting, inventory management, customer relationship management, and marketing.

### Healthcare

Computers are used in healthcare for various purposes, including patient monitoring, electronic medical records, and medical imaging.

# Information, Communication and Computers

Learn how information can be communicated in a common system.

Computers, information, and communication all depend on one another. Communication has been the primary tool that humans have had throughout history to exchange and process information. In fact, our progress would not have been possible if humans, as a species, didn't have the faculty called language. This process of communication has been revolutionized with the invention of computers, giving us vital instruments for fast and efficient communication. Let's find out about the information, it's types, and how it can be exchanged between two parties for successful communication.

## Information

**Information** is a collection of data or facts that have been organized and processed meaningfully.

### Types of Information

These are some common types of information:

- **Descriptive Information**: Describes an object, person, color size, shape and location.
- **Analytical Information**: Analyzes and evaluates data or information with comparisons. 
- **Social Information**: Pertains to social structures, behaviors, cultural practices, and social trends.
- **Explanatory Information**: Explains the significance of something with an explanation.
- **Historical Information**: Records past events or historical data.

## Communication

It is the process in which messages are exchanged between individuals by a communal system of symbols, signs, or behaviors. The following are important aspects that need to be considered for effective/meaningful communication:

### Common System

A **Common System** means that all parties must share a common language and a shared understanding of the syntax and semantics of that language.

Suppose two parties try to communicate but speak different languages. In that case, they can't communicate effectively unless they find a common language or a translator who can bridge the language barrier. In other words, if two people are trying to communicate and one speaks English and the other speaks French, then communication might not occur.

### Syntax and Semantics

Even if two people speak the same language, they may still have difficulty communicating if they have different interpretations of the syntax and semantics of that language. **Syntax** refers to the rules for constructing sentences and phrases, while **semantics** refers to the meaning of words and sentences.

## Language Components

According to Collins dictionary, **language** is the use of a system of communication that consists of a set of sounds or written symbols. The following are commonly used components of languages that people employ to convey messages to others.

## Symbols

Symbols are *visual representations* that have agreed upon meanings within a culture or group. Examples of symbols include letters of the alphabet, traffic signs, emojis and logos.

### Egyptian Hieroglyphs

Historically speaking, Egyptian hieroglyphs were an important tool for communication in ancient Egypt. They were used to record a wide range of information, including religious texts, historical events, legal and administrative documents, and personal correspondences.

### Facial Expressions

Facial expressions are important forms of nonverbal communication that convey emotions, attitudes and intentions.

### Words

Words are a combination of symbols, typically letters from an alphabet, representing a term or concept. We can form words by combining letters in a certain order.

For example, the word “COMPUTING” is made up of the letters C, O, M, P, U, T, I, N, and G. When we combine these letters in this specific order, we create a word that refers to a term that means “operations of computers.”

### Sentences

We can combine words to create sentences and convey more complex meanings. For example, the sentence “Hello, How are you?” consists of two parts: the greeting “Hello” and the question “How are you?” When combined, these words form a polite and friendly greeting that is often used in both formal and informal settings.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Not every arrangement of valid words results in a valid sentence.

The key elements for successful communication are a sender, a receiver, and a common system where individuals (sender and receiver) can transmit messages with mutual comprehension. In computers, the very same communication process is followed, but they have devices and software components that facilitate the communication process.

## Communication Through Computers

Computers facilitate the exchange of information and enable communication in our modern world. These powerful machines are essential tools for processing, storing, and transmitting vast amounts of data. Computers allow us to connect and communicate with others across long distances through various platforms like email, instant messaging, and social media.

# Binary System

## A System of Two States

Learn about the binary systems and their uses.

Imagine a scenario where we have to communicate with someone using the fewest possible symbols. A single symbol can without a doubt communicate one state, but what about the scenario when we want to communicate that the state doesn't need to exist anymore? We need to be able to represent *at least two states*.

## Binary System

A **binary system** is a system that uses only two symbols or states to represent information. Any two distinct symbols/states can be used for this purpose. For example:

- Up/Down
- Black/White
- Red/Green
- Apple/Orange
- True/False
- Open/Close
- On/Off

Such a system -- relating to, composed of, or involving two things -- is called a binary system. State 1 is represented by one symbol, and State 2 is represented by another one.

How does Binary work practically? Let's examine an example of railway signs.

## Railway Signals

Railway signals are a classic example of the binary system. These signals use two distinct states to convey information to train drivers about whether to proceed or not.

Railway signals use a system of two colors to convey information: red and green. A red signal indicates that the train must stop, while a green signal indicates that it’s safe to proceed.

The binary system is also used in digital computing, computer hardware, information, and voltage representations. Let’s look at the detailed significance of the binary system.

## Significance of the Binary System

> The binary system is widely used in digital computing systems and operations.

### Digital Computing

The binary system forms the foundation of digital computing systems and operations. The digital computer system uses the binary system to represent and process information. All digital devices operate on a binary system, including computers, smartphones, and other digital devices. The binary system is used in digital computing operations such as arithmetic, logic and comparison.

### Information Representation

A binary system can represent any information, including numbers, text, images and videos. 

- Numbers can be represented in a binary system by breaking them down into binary digits.
- Text can be represented by mapping each character to a unique binary code.
- Images and videos can be represented by converting their pixel values into binary codes.

### Computer Hardware

The binary system is used in computer hardware to store and process information. Computer hardware components, such as memory chips and central processing units, use the binary system to store and manipulate data.

### Voltage Representation

In computers, a binary system perfectly maps the presence and absence of voltage. The presence of voltage is represented by 1, while the absence of voltage is represented by 0. This representations is used in digital circuits and electronic devices.

Using the binary system for data representation allows digital computers to communicate by transmitting binary signals through communication channels. This form of communication based on the binary system is essential in modern digital technology because it enables the exchange of information and the functioning of the internet.

> **Note:**
> 
> - Any number can be represented in binary.
> - Any information that can be mapped to number(s) can, therefore, be represented in binary. So, it all becomes a matter of mapping information (audio, image, video, etc.) to numbers.

# Represent Information with Binary System

Learn how to create and exchange information with the binary system.

## Using Flags to Represent Information

Flags can communicate important information, such as distress signals and warnings. One example of using flags to communicate is the practice of flying flags at the full mast or half mast.

### One Flag

A single flag with two positions (up and down) can be used to convey two distinct messages. For example, a flag flown up high may signify "Advance", while a lowered flag may signal "Retreat".

| **Flag** | **Message** |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Up       | Advance     |
| Down     | Retreat     |

### Multiple Flags

We use multiple flags to create a larger set of symbols, which allows for transmitting more messages. This is the same as how combining alphabets creates words and sentences.

For example, with two flags, each flag can be assigned one of the two states, having a total of 2 * 2 = 4 possible combinations. We calculate combinations by multiplying the number of states for each flag. Each combination can then be assigned a unique message (in human terms) that allows the transmission of up to 4 distinct messages.

| Two Flags with Four Messages |            |                           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| **Flag 1**                   | **Flag 2** | **Message**               |
| Down                         | Down       | I am sinking              |
| Down                         | Up         | I am abandoning my vessel |
| Up                           | Down       | Retreat                   |
| Up                           | Up         | Advance                   |
Similarly, with a set of three flags, each flag can be assigned one of two states (up or down), totaling 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible combinations. 

We can convey a number of possible messages using a set of flags. As a general rule, if there are *N*  flags, each with two possible states (up or down), the total number of unique possible combinations and messages that can be conveyed is 2 raised to the power of *N*, as shown in the table below:

| **No. of Flags** | **Number of Messages** | **Possible combinations** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1                | 2                      | 21                        |
| 2                | 2 x 2 = 4              | 22                        |
| 3                | 2 x 2 x 2 = 8          | 23                        |
| 4                | 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16     | 24                        |
| 5                | 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 | 25                        |
| 6                | 64                     | 26                        |
| 7                | 128                    | 27                        |
| 8                | 256                    | 28                        |
| 9                | 512                    | 29                        |
| 10               | 1024                   | 210                       |
| ...              | ...                    | ...                       |
| N                |                        | 2N                        |
> The concept of flags with multiple possible states can be extended to exchanging information in computers. In a computer system, **binary digits** or **bits**, are the fundamental units used to represent and process data. Each bit can be in one of two states, typically represented as 0 or 1. By grouping multiple bits, we can represent more complex information.

# Essential Number Systems

Get introduced to number systems, and understand their basics using everyday numbers as an example.
## What is a Number System?

Evidence from early civilizations shows that humans have been counting for a long time. Indeed, counting is an essential tool for daily life. So, naturally, humans have developed systems that relate unique symbols to specific values. These are what we call **number systems**.

### What Trait Should a Number System Have?

Let's take an example from early civilization, where an employee and an employer are selling fruits in the market. The employer hands over a certain number of fruits to sell in the market to the employee. The employer has a pile of peach marbles with him, which is exactly equal to the number of fruits he has handed over to his employee.

The employee sells all the fruits and returns to their employer. The employee is expected to bring along another pile of marbles, equivalent to the number of fruits they sold. The employer compares the two piles of marbles by doing one-to-one matching, observing whether they are smaller/larger or if both piles are equal. This was their simplest way of counting in the absence of a number system.

Now suppose that we want to do this without having both piles in front of us. We want to count one pile, quantify it to a value, and then have someone else tell us the value of the other pile. Then, like before, we want to compare the two values, to determine which is greater, or if they're equal. Perhaps, in our number system, we also want to learn exactly how much greater one value would be in comparison to the other.

Essentially, we need our system to:

- Have unique symbols for every value
- Be consistent and have comparable values
- Be easily scalable

#### Scalability

If we want widespread use of our system, we can't expect everyone to memorize symbols upon symbols. The expectation is that some basic knowledge would allow perfect use of the system. For example, in our everyday number system, all numbers beyond 9 are generated by a combination of the existing numbers.

#### Consistency and Comparability

Scalability is easily possible if our system is *consistent*. That means that the rules that apply to the first few numbers in our system must also apply to the ones after that and so on. As we saw, comparability is an essential factor. Two numbers, however large, should be comparable just by looking at their structure and knowing the derivation rules and basics of the system. 

#### Uniqueness

Finally, we have the most important property: unique symbols for every value. Without unique symbols, we can't have a useable system. To achieve this, we have a set of *n* base symbols representing the first *n* values in our number system. The subsequent values would be combinations of these *n* symbols, derived by following specific rules.

This way, we ensure uniqueness, but with an inherent scalability and consistency. The simplest example is our everyday number system: no two values are represented by the same symbol combination.

### The Decimal System

We will discuss the idea of using `n` base symbols to build a number system using the examnple of our everyday number system: the decimal system. 

#### Base Symbols

The **decimal system** has 10 base symbols, or digits. Thus, it is also called the **base-10 system**. We learn these symbols, the numbers 0-9, as soon as we begin our schooling. We also learn the rules to construct further numbers: 10 and onwards.

#### Place Value

The rules on how to construct a number system (and in all *n*-base number systems) depend on the number's place value. This is the value a digit will have according to its position in the sequence of the number. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/d76tLpc.png)

In the decimal number system, the place value of each digit increases in powers of 10 from right to left. The rightmost digit represents 10^0 or 1, the next digit represents 10^1 or 10, the next one represents 10^2 or 100, and so on. This is because the decimal system uses a base of 10, meaning we have 10 base symbols (0-9) to represent numbers.

## Introduction to the Binary System

Get introduced to the base symbols and representation rules of the binary system.

### What is the Binary System?

The decimal system leverages the fact that humans have 10 fingers to count with. The binary number system does something similar in the case of computers. 

An essential component of computers is the **transistor**, which has two states, on and off. These are sometimes also referred to as high and low states, and **correspond to the presence or absence of voltage.** Each state can be represented using one of two symbols - 0 and 1 - resulting in a numbering system with base 2. The binary system is a two-base system.

#### Base Digits

The base digit for the binary system are simple: 0 to represent a low state and 1 to represent a high state. 

#### Place Value

Like in the decimal system, the rules for representing a number in binary come from the place values of the digits. We know that the rule was that place values correspond to ascending powers of 10 from right to left. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**: For the binary system, the rule is that -- you guessed it -- place values correspond to ascending powers of 2 from right to left. 

**Recall that binary digits are referred to as *bits***.

### MSB and LSB

**MSB** is the **most significant bit**. It is the leftmost bit of a binary number and the one with the largest place values. Similarly, the **LSB**, or **least significant bit**, is the rightmost bit and the one with a place value of 1. The same symbol 1 in different places can have different values. For example, in 001, the MSB is 0, and in 100, the MSB is 1 and vice versa for LSB. 

These terms make referring to binary numbers easier and can also be used to talk about groups of bits. For example, we can say "four least significant bits" to refer to the four right-most bits in our number.

#### Range

This is all well and good, but you might be thinking that it was lucky for us that we had five places to start with for the example above. So, how would we know how many places an arbitrary number would take up to be represented in binary? 

For that, we need to think about the range of a set of bits.

Let's think about how many different numbers we can represent with two bits. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/18ZWl2D.png)

> We can represent four numbers from 0-3. Let's now see how many numbers we can represent with three bits.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**: We already know that we can have four different numbers with two bits, which could each either be `0` or `1`. If we add a third bit, it could also either be `0` or `1`. So, we may extend each of the four two-bit binary numbers with a 0 on the left and then with a `1` on the left, giving `4 x 2 = 8` different numbers. So, each bit contributes to doubling the number. In the following illustration, we are showing only the ones where the leftmost bit is `1`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0toIIlh.png)

Let’s try to come up with an expression for the range of bits. This means we want an expression to calculate how many (and what) numbers we can represent using nn bits.

Can we use the patterns we observed in our two examples to do this? Let’s see.

A single digit $(n=1)(n=1)$ binary number can have two different values (00 or 11). When we take the number of bits to $n=2n=2,$ the number of possible values increases to $2×2=222×2=22.$ When we take the number of bits to three digits, the number of possible values increases to $2×2×2=232×2×2=23$. Notice that for nn binary digits, we have all the kk numbers available that we did for (n−1)(n−1) digits. This happens when we turn the nnth MSB digit off. Additionally, we have the option of turning the nnth digit on, which gives kk more possible numbers. This brings our total to 2k2k. Thus, with every increase in nn, we are multiplying the possible combinations by 22. We then have:

## Binary Conversions

Learn more about binary conversions, including shortcuts, and practice working with the binary converter tool.

Decimal numbers are more intuitive and easier for humans to understand. Similarly, binary numbers are the fundamental representation of data in computing systems. Converting binary to decimal facilitates communication between computers and humans and enables compatibility with decimal-based systems and operations.

### Binary to Decimal Conversion

We know that the binary system has place values that are powers of $2$. These values act as *weights for the digits* (0 or 1) in those positions. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** As we saw above, we simply multiplied each digit by its weight (the power of 22) and then summed them all up to get the decimal number.

### Decimal to Binary Conversion - Division Method

We have developed the intuition of a number's binary representation as the summation of powers of $2$. Now, let's learn how to convert a decimal number to binary. One method to do this is *repeated division*, which we shall see below.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** In the example above, we have seen that repeatedly dividing by 22 and keeping track of the remainder is a shortcut for converting decimal to binary.

## Introduction to the Hexadecimal System

Get to know the hexadecimal number system, why we need it and how to represent numbers using it.
