# What is this and who is this for?

There are 2 situations where my advice is completely useless: 

1. If you think you are already “good enough” at learning, already know the best way for you to learn, or have a very strong identity of “this is who I am,” this guide is not for you. I am not trying to make you feel guilty – I have much better things to do with my life than being passive-aggressive with you; I am just saying that advice is kind of useless if you don’t think you need it. Honestly, I had many students who actively did not want advice, kept doing what they did without listening to my advice, and got A’s. That’s great! (sadly, some of these people were getting F’s, kept doing what they did, and kept getting F’s.) 

2. If you simply don’t care about getting better at learning, then my advice is also useless. Again, this is not to make you feel guilty – many people don’t care about becoming better students. They care about other things more, like finances, personal problems, love and relationships, their band, etc. I honestly think it’s your right to choose what you care and what you do not care about. Nobody is trying to offend you. I want to value your time.
## What is Learning?

What do I mean by *learning*? I mean how good you are at getting *better* at something. Note this is not about how good you *are*. You can be strong at math and weak at *learning math*. Learning is hard. It is hard because of many Painful Truths and Dangerous Traps, starting with this one:

**Painful Truth**: Most people are weak at learning. If you are weak at learning, you will likely find it very hard to get a competitive job that requires real skills. This is because if you do not learn skills quickly, you are at a disadvantage compared to people who learn skills quicker than you, even if you have a head start.
	Mental experiment: if you "just played" volleyball everyday for an hour or two, then in 2000 hours you are bound to be pretty good compared to normal folk. But I think you'd be better if you spent 1000 hours in a team, with each practice session having a goal (and drills to hit the goal, games to train the goal, and a coach to give you goals). This means you could have saved 1000 hours. 1000 hours is a very long time.

I'm not pretending to be above you, or to have figured it all out. It took me a long time myself to realize how **weak** I was at learning math (and i am finding inefficiencies in my own learning even now). The hardest part for me was admitting to myself I was bad at learning math. **Even though** I was pretty good at math. I felt really stupid when I realized this, but once I did, I got a lot better. 

**Proposed Solution to Painful Truth**: Be honest to yourself. This allows you to find weaknesses. For each weakness, make a goal to attack it. **Practice things that train you for your goal**. Practice LESS things that don't directly train you for your goal. 
## What should my goal be?

You can actually set your goal to be anything, but a good guiding principle is "what is my weakest skill?" because that's probably what's holding you back the most. Then you ask "What is my weakest part of that skill?" **and keep going**. 

For example:

1. Most people who are weak at math classes are weak at **taking exams**. 
2. This is too broad, so let's now find the weakest part of taking exams. What's an exam? It is many things (like dealing with time pressure, psychology, etc.) but I think the main part is usually **being able to solve new problems**.
3. This is still too broad. So you ask "what's my weakest point when solving new problems?"
4. You keep doing until you find something *specific*, and train that. What does it mean to be specific? It means you can make a *drill*.
5. (Yes, yes I would actually prefer your goals to be more broad, like an appreciation for mathematics, being a good person, etc, but I'm respecting the fact that you may have different goals than mine).

**Deadly Trap**: The main reason most people in the world are bad at learning is that they practice what they are *good* at instead of what they are *weak* at. 
	For example, they're weak at solving problems and good at reading. So when they review, they read. They'll then feel good (since they're good at reading). Then on the actual exam they are not asked to read, but to solve problems. Since they were always afraid to actually solve problems by themselves, they never got good at solving problems. Then they fail the exam. 
## "I Found a Specific Weakness, Now What?"
