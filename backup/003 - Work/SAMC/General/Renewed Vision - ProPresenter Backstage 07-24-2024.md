## Why Does Production in the Church Matter?

- Always emphasize quality over quantity.
- Create intimacy in rooms that are not intimate
- Lead the worship leader
- Rehearse!
- Sell the fun of production to the unchurched.
- Train the volunteers well and feed them well
- Recruit the youth, buy them the tools and set them loose.
- Record and review... make it a game. 
	- What is the next shot?
- Real creativity happens on a budget
	- Do more with less
- Quick interruptions > Long distractions
- Volunteers can be fired
	- Free their future
- Be calm, it will be okay
- The most prepared can be the most flexible
- If you only stop working when the work stops, you'll never stop working

## Some Things we Are Thinking About
- Cloud
	- Playlist building
	- Backups
	- Ability to edit and work on slides from home
- Audience Interaction
	- Embedded framework
	- Not a separate application
	- Slides that can be affected by crowd interaction (polling, etc.)
- Data Links
	- Updated to a spreadsheet and read data in real time
- Better Slide Drawing
	- Better editing tools like what's available in PowerPoint etc.
	- Stickers, similar to clip art (these looked cheesy at first, but after some manipulation looked pretty nice, my first throughts were applications in Children's Ministry)

### Features and Ideas

- Live Bible lookups
- HDMI vs. SDI
	- HDMI depended on Operating System
	- SDI is independent and offers more control
