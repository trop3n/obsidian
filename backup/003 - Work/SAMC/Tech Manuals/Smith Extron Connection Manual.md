## Step 1

1. Turn on LED Screen on the Extron Panel
2. Verify that your source is correct:
	1. Sharelink will allow you to share your laptop screen
	2. Sanctuary VPR takes input from the computer in VPR

## Step 2

1. On your laptop, open the **Google Chrome** browser (you have to use this browser)
2. Enter the IP Address: 172.16.16.128

| First Octet     | Second Octet    | Third Octet     | Fourth Octet                                       |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 172.            | 16.             | 16.             | 128                                                |
| Always the same | Always the same | Always the same | Based on the room number you are in (Smith is 128) |
3. Once the IP Address is entered, you will get a **Certificate Warning**
		This means that the browser is not using HTTPS, but HTTP instead. All modern browsers mandate that all web sites use the HTTPS protocol. 

4. Click on **Advanced**, then click on **Proceed to site 172.16.16.128 (unsafe)**
		Security wise, this is okay. You will not compromise your system or the network.

5. Use **WebShare**, and select **Share**.

## Step 3

1. You will see a screen with three input fields:
	1. Code: this is the code that appears in the bottom left corner of the LED screen.
	2. Password: 5801
	3. Your name: Enter your name.

3. Click **Connect**.

4. You will get a pop up window with three options:
	1. Chrome tab
	2. Window
	3. Entire Screen

5. Select **Entire Screen**
		If you need audio, select the audio toggle on the bottom right of the pop up window.
		Select the screen you want to share, then select **Share**. 

**You are now sharing your entire screen**. Feel free to minimize your browser, then maximize the content you want to share (PowerPoint, YouTube, etc.)
