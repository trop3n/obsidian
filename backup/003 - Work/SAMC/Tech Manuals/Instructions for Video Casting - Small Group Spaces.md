## Some Introductory Information

The majority of the small group rooms use Crestron units to cast to the mounted televisions in each room. 

These units are typically connected to using a cell phone, laptop, or other casting device, which mirrors the output of the device onto the screen.
## Room Setup

1. Verify that the television is powered on, and have the remote nearby.
2. Once the television is powered on, it should display a screen with the St. Andrew Logo and in the bottom left corner, and IP address and access code.
3. Verify the device you are using is connected to the **St. Andrew** Wi-Fi Network (this network is open, and does not require a password)
4. Enter the IP address into a web browser address bar, like so:

For all small group spaces, the IP addresses will follow a similar format:

| First Octet | Second Octet | Third Octet | Fourth Octet                             |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 172         | 16           | 16          | 126                                      |
| Standard    | Standard     | Standard    | The room number you are currently using. |
5. Press **Enter** on the browser address bar. It will display a page like this:

**This is expected browser behavior. In most browsers, there will be an "Advanced" button. Press the "Advanced" button to display additional buttons that will lead you to the Crestron AirMedia connection page.**

A brief explanation: This certificate is generated by Crestron Electronics, and does not come from a *certificate authority*, which all modern web browsers want to see when connecting to a website. Because this is from St. Andrew's internal network and we can verify the contents of the web page beyond this warning, it is *safe to use this certificate*.

On your device, you should see this web page after continuing to the site. 
## Windows Device

If you are using a Windows device, you can either connect using these on screen instructions or by downloading the AirMedia application via the link provided on this web page.

**If you are using any content that has audio, please connect with MiraCast as described on the the webpage above. Connecting with the AirMedia application will not allow audio playback on some Windows devices.**

- For Room 126, the display will be called **Samsung 6 Series - 65**.

In your casting settings, located in the bottom right of the taskbar on a Windows device (next to the calendar and clock). You can change from "Extend" to "Duplicate" to if you want your device screen to mirror the output on the TV. "Extend" will treat the TV as an additional output, essentially a second monitor. 
## Apple Device

If using an Apple device, simply use the "Screen Mirroring" function and select the "Room-126-TV" option from the list of available devices. 

This will connect you to the display and provide both **video and audio output**.

## Once You are Connected

Once you have verified that your device is properly connected, navigate to the desired content you wish to display on your laptop or device, and press play.
