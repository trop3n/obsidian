- [ ] **Ross Dashboard Routings**

	- Verify the routings on the Ross dashboard NK Matrix are mapped properly, according to the prior NK Switchboard Excel Spreadsheet.
	- Test the switcher, and verify that cameras have come back online at their correct placements on VPR monitors.

- [ ] **Elgato Streamdeck**

	- Verify the Streamdeck is lit up with the correct lighting cues.
	- If the Streamdeck is lit, but has no available cues to press, check the CG02 MacMini and verify that both Streamdeck software applications are **NOT** running at the same time. 
	- Once only Configuration is the only Elgato software running, it should remember the previous configuration and present the correct lighting cues.
	- Verify the Streamdeck affects lighting in the venue by changing it.

- [ ] **PTZ Cameras**

	- Test and verify that all PTZ cameras are functioning normally once reconfigured.

- [ ] **CG01 and CG02**

	- If only one screen is functional, copy the NovaLCT configuration from the functional Novastar server rack and load it to hardware on the non functional one. 
	- This should fix the issue.
