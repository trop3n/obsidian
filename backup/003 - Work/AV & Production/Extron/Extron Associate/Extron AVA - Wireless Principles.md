## What is Wireless Communication?

Wireless communication is a method of transporting information between devices that are not physically connected with cables or wires. The signal transfer uses antennas to transform electrical signals as electromagnetic waves to move audio, video, and data.

Electromagnetic waves are analog, while the information in a computer system is digital. Wireless networks, therefore, need adapters and routers to translate between analog waves and digital signals.

These wireless signals can be transmitted either in one direction (to a radio or TV), or bi-directionally. Intermediate points can also achieve wireless communication with the use of satellites, mobile networks, and Wireless Access Points – WAPs.

## Advantages of Wireless Technology

In a wired network, the components are fixed in one place as the data transmits over a copper or fiber infrastructure. When users are connected by physical cables, their movement is limited from a static location. The primary advantage of wireless technology is mobility, which enables people to interact, work, pay bills, shop, play games and access video and audio content regardless of location.

The management of a wireless infrastructure is the same whether connecting one user or a million. For example, to offer service in a given area, base stations and antennas are needed. Once that infrastructure is built, expansion and scalability are simplified. Adding a new device or user is merely a matter of configuring the system to authorize their access and services.

In a wired network, this can involve construction, running cables, punching down terminals, and patching new jacks. This flexibility in wireless systems translates into reduced installation costs combined with rapid deployment.

## Limitations Wireless Communication

While wireless technology has a number of advantages over wired systems, there are several factors that can affect wireless signal quality. The following are some of the most common:

- Distance – Range of coverage is limited
- Line of Sight – Barriers or obstructions
- Interference – Susceptible to other wireless signals or power sources
- Reliability – Signal strength and inconsistent connectivity
- Speed – Latency delays can cause slower upload and download transfer rates
- Bandwidth – Can be restricted, however it could have similar throughput to wired systems
- Security – Potential data interception
- Weather – Heavy rain and clouds interrupt signals

# Wireless Networks

## Establishing Specifications

Technical standards are formal documents to establish a set of uniform specifications, requirements, and processes for materials, components, systems, test methods, service etc. The following organizations create standards for wireless networks and establish specifications to define how wireless systems should operate. 

[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers – IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) is an international society of technical professionals that develop standards for different electrical and electronic engineering disciplines. IEEE addresses several technical fields, such as the 802.11 standard, which implements a set of protocols so that all Wi-Fi devices can communicate with each other in a Wireless Local Area Network – WLAN.

[Wi-Fi Alliance](https://www.wi-fi.org/) is comprised of major organizations in the wireless space that define wireless networks and WLAN products as having met 802.11 standards for interoperability, security, and application-specific protocols.

## 802.11 Background

> Since 802.11 wireless technology was first released in 1997, Wi-Fi standards have continually advanced, typically resulting in faster speeds and wider coverage. The following table illustrates the progression of the 802.11 standard. With every new capability comes an amendment to the 802.11 name that sets the standards apart.

| **Standard**            | **Year** | **Frequency** | **Bandwidth**       | **Data Rate** | **Modulation** |

**Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum** - **DSSS** combines data signals with higher bit rates to transmit over a wider band.

**Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum** - **FHSS** data hops to various frequency channels to spread the signal.

**Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing** - **OFDM** has overlapping signals act independently to increase data transmission efficiency.

**Multiple Input Multiple Output** - **MIMO** uses multiple antennas to increase channel capacity.

## Wireless Local Area Network

A **Wireless Local Area Network** (WLAN) manages the use of wireless devices, which have sensors or antennas to connect and communicate over high frequency radio waves. However, since these signals reduce the need to depend on wires, it does not mean that cables are omitted. 

Wireless systems are typically integrated into a wired Local Area Network - LAN, where routers and server are physically connected to move data over well-defined copper or fiber cables. This enables wireless and wired products to be used together, especially in AV systems across a corporate or campus network.

### Wireless Router

**A Wireless Router** performs the functions of a router and includes a built-in Access Point – AP that connects wireless-enabled devices to the Internet, wired LAN, or WLAN. These are mostly used in residential and small businesses where many users can be supported with a single device.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xeSTAjo.png)

### Wireless AP

**The Wireless Access Point - WAP** are small base station devices with a built-in network adapter, antenna, and radio transceiver. APs organize the communication of all wireless devices connected in a wired LAN. Mostly used in larger businesses and venue to provide wireless service.

The [Extron WAP 100AC](https://www.extron.com/product/wap100ac) is a ceiling mounted wireless AP that supports dual-band frequency operation and four internal high-gain antennas to maximize network performance and expand device connectivity.

![](https://i.imgur.com/R0n7ngw.png)


### WNIC

**The Wireless Network Interface Card - WNIC** is a radio transceiver that enables wireless connectivity to a WLAN. These are typically connected to a computer's motherboard or USB port.

## WLAN Topologies

When designing a wireless network, several factors are considered when organizing wireless devices, or stations and allocating various tasks. The network topology refers to the location of devices so they can communicate and provide optimal coverage and capacity.

Similar to wired networks having different topologies, wireless networks are typically implemented in one of two WLAN structures:

### Adhoc Mode

**Adhoc Mode** is an unmanaged peer-to-peer system where wireless devices can communicate directly with each other without requiring a centralized AP. This quick connection method can be set up temporarily to share files and resources.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hwjh70i.png)

### Infrastructure Mode

**Infrastructure Mode** is a managed system used to extend wired LAN functionality to wireless devices through an AP. Since most APs are not mobile, they stay connected to the wired network and become part of the "infrastructure".

![](https://i.imgur.com/5APy5qB.png)

## WLAN Service Sets and Identifiers

Wireless networks are designed to make signal detection a seamless process when stations are transitioning in and out of various roaming areas. Since neighboring signals are typically on different channels to avoid interference, wireless network administrators use names to identify wireless connections.

The following terms are used to identify sections of a wireless network:

- **Independent Basic Service Set – IBSS** support adhoc mode when two or more stations communicate with each other without a central AP.
- **Distribution System – DS** interconnects wireless APs to expand a wireless network without the requirement for a wired backbone.
- **Service Set Identifier – SSID** is a simple name given to an AP, or wireless network.
- **Basic Service Set – BSS** supports infrastructure mode where stations only communicate with a central AP that manages all traffic.
- **Basic Service Set Identifier – BSSID** is the MAC address of the radio on the AP.
- **Extended Service Set – ESS** contains multiple APs with the same SSID that form a subnetwork.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BRYtp79.png)

## Bluetooth Communication

**Bluetooth** is a wireless technology transmitting voice and data at high speeds using radio waves. It is easy to connect mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops that are typically within 10 meters of each other, creating a **Personal Area Network - PAN**. This 802.15.1 standard is not Wi-Fi but operates in the same frequency space at 2.4 GHz, with a signaling rate of up to 2 Mbps, and uses FHSS to avoid interference.

Bluetooth works great for making phone calls in the audio system of your car, playing music through a wireless speaker or headset, and connecting a computer to various peripheral devices, such as a mouse and keyboard using a Bluetooth USB dongle.

|Bluetooth Version|Basic Rate|Enhanced Data Rate|High Speed|Low Energy|Slot Availability Masking|Version Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Bluetooth 1.x|Yes|No|No|No|No|No optional profiles or codecs  <br>  <br>Rarely implemented on mobile devices  <br>  <br>Limited speed (1 Mbps)  <br>  <br>Difficulty pairing / Obsolete|
|Bluetooth 2.x|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|Enhanced data rates (3 Mbps)  <br>  <br>Simplified pairing  <br>procedure|
|Bluetooth 3.x|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|High-Speed feature  <br>  <br>Transmits over adjacent radio (802.11)  <br>  <br>Consumes more power than Bluetooth 2.x|
|Bluetooth 4.x|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|Low Energy reduces power  <br>  <br>Collects low rate device data from sensors  <br>  <br>Smartwatches, heart monitors, mobile phones, and smart headphones|
|Bluetooth 5.x|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Suited for the Internet of Things (IoT)  <br>  <br>Twice the bandwidth of 4.x range  <br>  <br>Prevents interference on neighboring bands|
## Infrared Technology

**Infrared - IR** light is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths that are just beyond those of visible light. It is used in night vision devices and thermal imaging which shows heat when there is no visible light source. Infrared communication signals do not penetrate walls and require an approximate line of sight of 10 meters.

Most remote controls for TVs or media players focus an infrared **Light Emitting Diode** - LED into a narrow beam by a plastic lens. The information being transmitted, such as the channel number, is encoded into the signal. The receiver converts the infrared radiation into an electric current and decodes the information.

AII IR remotes use the infrared frequency range (300 mHz - 400 gHz), which should not be confused with the modulation rate (carrier frequency). Typically for IR, the frequency is in the 30-60 kHz range.

## Zigbee Networks

**Zigbee** is a low-power, low-data rate and close proximity wireless technology for home automation and data collection systems. Zigbee signals have a limited transmission distance up to 100 meters.

Typical Zigbee systems have a central coordinating hub that monitors and controls smart devices, such as lights, thermostats, security cameras, etc. A wireless gateway interfaces with the Zigbee network and Internet to provide remote operation. This 802.15.4 standard operates at 2.4 GHz with a throughput of up to 250 Kbps, best suited for intermittent communication with a sensor or input device.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b7X8w4y.png)

## Other Wireless Technologies

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Near Field Communication – NFC**|Short-range RFID technology uses magnetic field induction to validate data transfer, perform contactless transactions, access secure digital content, and connect electronic devices by touching or bringing them into close proximity.|
|**Cellular**|Mobile technology divides large coverage areas into smaller sections, or cells, enabling simultaneous transmission and reception for mobile phones.|
|**Microwave**|Point-to-point technology uses high frequency radio waves to send and receive video, audio, and data. Their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow beams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna|
|**Radar**|Detection system to determine properties of an object. Radio waves from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving the range, location, angle, and velocity of the object.|
|**Satellite**|Communication objects in the Earth’s orbit that provide video, audio, IP data, radio, space observation, military, positioning (GPS), and many others.|
## Wireless Security

Since wireless signals are transmitted in open space, one of the main concerns of wireless communication is security of the data, and keeping our devices from being compromised. By definition, a wireless medium is not a well-defined path of a physical cable, so the radio waves tend to travel beyond boundaries. This makes it possible for people and devices with unauthorized access to eavesdrop, intercept signals, and acquire sensitive information.

When wireless networks are built, careful consideration is given to prevent unauthorized use. With the development of wireless protocols, tools, and technologies, authenticating wireless users and encrypting traffic has become more effective.

## Wireless Security Threats

Wireless threats come in all forms. From someone attaching to your AP without authorization to grabbing packets out of the air and decoding them. Wireless data hackers can potentially access the network from a parking lot or across the street using an antenna.

Below are some of the common threats to wireless networks:

- **Eavesdropping** – Gaining access to a wireless transmission to "listen in" or read unencrypted traffic, often referred to as sniffing or snooping.
    
- **Denial of Service** – Potential attackers who cannot gain access to the wireless network can jam or flood it with static noise to prevent normal operation.
    
- **Man in the Middle** – A rogue AP can be set up to intercept passing data from connected users to monitor, capture, and control the communication transparently.

## Security Methods

There are several different ways to secure and protect the integrity of a wireless network with strong encryption and authentication policies:

- **Wired Equivalent Privacy – WEP** is the original security standard for wireless networks used 64-bit and 128-bit encryption keys. WEP became insecure and deprecated in favor of WPA.
    
- **Wireless Protected Access – WPA** supports Temporary Key Integrity Protocol – TKIP, which encrypts every packet with a unique 256-bit key, meaning that if an attacker does decrypt one packet, the rest of the stream is useless.
    
- **WPA2** supports Advanced Encryption Standard – AES algorithms as an encryption tool that resets itself after each block of data is processed.
    
- **WPA3** uses Device Provisioning Protocol – DPP to register new devices through processes that don’t require a shared password, such as QR codes or NFC (RFID) tags.
    
- **MAC Address Filtering** is a network card's MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number that is unique to each network card. The AP can limit access to only authorized devices.

# Wireless Communication

## Transmitting Wireless Signals

As previously discussed, wireless signals are transported using electromagnetic waves. But how are signal waves created and sent to their destination through the air?

It all starts with the transmitter. To initiate the wireless communication, the source signal is encoded and modulated internally before it propagates to the antenna of the device (laptop, tablet, or smartphone). Since the antenna is a conductor, electric current moves towards the end of the antenna. When the antenna radiates alternating signals outward as an electromagnetic wave, the wireless data transfer begins.

![](https://i.imgur.com/no0Ddoh.png)

## Bandwidth and Distance Categories

Wireless communication is developed to the effective within certain frequency ranges and distances. The following transmission types define the communication channels for wireless signals:

- **Narrowband**: 8 kHz frequency band with a 12.5 kHz channel spacing between the center of adjacent channels. Applications requiring low data rates, long distances, high power, and reliable communication.
- **Wideband**: 16 kHz frequency band with a 25 kHz channel spacing between the center of adjacent channels. Transfers high data rates, short distances, low power and less reliable communication.

The following three categories identify the distance ranges for wireless signals:

- **Short-range**: Signals that travel very short distances, from a few centimeters to several meters (Bluetooth)
- **Medium-range**: Signals that travel up to 100 meters
- **Wide area**: Signals that travel from several kilometers to several thousand kilometers

![](https://i.imgur.com/iW18tKY.png)

## Frequency Bands

As the transmitter antenna sends the signal, it broadcasts in many directions and not typically a direct path to the receiver. Waves can reflect, diffract, and scatter off objects and still reach the receiver, however they may be weaker with some attenuation and delay.

In wireless systems, there are many signal types for WiFi, mobile phones, satellite, Bluetooth, etc. But what makes them different is their **Frequency**, which is the rate at which a signal wave repeats or completes a cycle, measured in Hertz - Hz. If the signal vibrates very quickly, it has a *high frequency*. If the signal vibrates slowly, it has a *low frequency*. The primary difference between various frequencies are the **range (coverage)** and **bandwidth (speed)**.

### 900 MHz

The 900 MHz band is a narrowband spectrum used for mobile radio to cover large areas by land transportation, utility, and manufacturing entities. Although the limitations of 900 MHz have lower speeds, congestion, and interference, the combination of long range propagation and low power consumption makes it ideal for sub 1 GHz communication.

To increase the range of Wi-Fi and connect devices that don't require high data rates, 802.11ah (HaLow) was introduced to operate in the 900 MHz band. WiFI HaLow provides communication targeted at the Internet of Things - IoT, where smart devices may be in locations that conventional Wi-Fi is unable to reach, up to 1 km.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uedjH9m.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/93Jaktc.png)

### 2.4 Ghz
\
A low frequency, long range wavelength that can pass through obstructions fairly well. Consequently, its good range can have many devices using it, causing crowded access and interference. The following are some of the more common devices and technologies that use the 2.4 GHz band:

- Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee
- Cordless Phone
- Baby monitor, Radio Control Toys
- Garage door openers, car alarms
- Microwave oven
- Wireless Microphones, speakers and cameras

### 5 GHz

As 2.4 GHz is for range, 5 GHz is **for speed**. It high frequency, short wavelengths cannot pass through obstacles as well as 2.4 GHz. However, because it is used by fewer devices and more channels to access, 5 GHz is less crowded and not as vulnerable to interference. 

The following devices are compatible with the 5 GHz band:
- Wi-Fi
- Smartphone, tablet, Smart TV
- Online music and video streaming
- Gaming console

![](https://i.imgur.com/agWPpJH.png)

### 60 GHz

The 60 GHz Wi-Fi band, or WiGig, enhances wireless devices to communicate at multi-gigabit speeds with low latency at distances up to 10 meters. *Beamforming* is used to focus signals between devices, transmit data more efficiently, and reduce interference.

The following devices are compatible with the 60 GHz band:
- Wi-Fi
- Streaming 4K video
- Remote surveillance camera
- Virtual Reality headset

![](https://i.imgur.com/78JMbQS.png)

## Channels

A wireless communication channel indicates the transmission medium for signal data in open air.

**Simplex**: One way communication. One device transmits on a channel to a receiving device (radio and television broadcasting).
**Half Duplex**: Two-way communication on a channel but not simultaneous. Only one device can transmit on a channel at a time (WiFi, CB radio, walkie-talkie)
**Full-Duplex**: Two way communication simultaneously (WAPs, mobile phones)

![](https://i.imgur.com/L9tpK1P.png)

## Channel Frequencies

**2.4 GHz** supports channels 1-11 at 20 MHz wide and spaced 5 MHz apart. Unfortunately, since the space between each band is so tight, adjacent channels that overlap can cause interference. A good plan for coverage is to keep all the same channels separated from each other. Thus, the only non-overlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11.

**5 GHz** provides 25 non-overlapping channels with more channel width options at 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz that result in faster data rates.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uNRbWgm.png)


![](https://i.imgur.com/9I9YMAM.png)


![](https://i.imgur.com/jUD1og8.png)

## Channel Interference

When configuring a wireless system, the APs provide a set of available channels to use during setup. Selecting the proper Wi-Fi channel can significantly improve wireless coverage and performance while avoiding sources of interference.

**Co-Channel Interference**: occurs when two or more AP's are using the same channel. This is a sort of congestion that hinders the performance as the same channel is used by different devices.

**Adjacent Channel Interference**: occurs when two or more AP's are on overlapping channels.

![](https://i.imgur.com/p4CCi8Y.png)

## Spread Spectrum

**Spread Spectrum** is a modulation technique that broadens the bandwidth of the transmitted signal without affecting the data. These techniques are effective in making signals resilient to noise, interference, and attenuation, while also making it difficult to jam or intercept.

Two methods of spread spectrum technologies are:
- **FHSS - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum** uses lower data rates and narrowband carrier "hops" from frequency to frequency in a pattern known to both transmitter and receiver.
- **DSSS - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum** uses longer and higher data rates to spread the wideband  carrier signal over a broad frequency range.

![](https://i.imgur.com/knO6iyO.png)

## Improving Performance

Advanced techniques can be combined with narrowband and spread spectrum technologies to improve the performance of a wireless system in the form of capacity.

### MIMO

**Multiple Input Multiple Output**: uses spatial multiplexing with multiple antennas on both transmitter and receiver to increase channel capacity. 

Multiple signal paths can cause timing issues, interference, and phase shifting. However, spatial multiplexing splits the high data rate signals into multiple lower data rate signals. Each stream is transmitted from a different antenna over the same frequency and uses multiple paths to arrive on the receiver, where the signal is restored. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/KTXtV7Q.png)

### OFDM

**Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing - OFDM** allows closer channel spacing where data is transmitted over multiple radio sub-carriers. These orthogonal frequencies allow overlapping signals to act independently to eliminate adjacent channel crosstalk and increase data transmission efficiency.

OFDM and MIMO are often combined to improve channel capacity and reduce interference in wireless systems.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1MUXapI.png)
### AFS

**Automatic Frequency Selection - AFS** scans the frequency range to select the clearest channel for transmission. If interference is detected on the same channel, the AFS system has two options:

- Stay on the channel and wait for the interfering signal to switch to another channel. If the interfering signal is present after a set time, the AFS system will switch to a new frequency. 
- Scan for a clear channel and switch.

![](https://i.imgur.com/dticsNb.png)

### DFS

**Dynamic Frequency Selection - DFS** is mandated by the Federal Communications Commission - FCC to avoid interference with weather radar and military applications in the following channels and frequency ranges of the 5 GHz spectrum:

- Channels 52-64, 100-144
- Channels 120, 124, and 128 - Doppler Radar
- 5250-5350 MHz
- 5470-5725 MHz

![](https://i.imgur.com/NVi3MYU.png)

### U-NII Bands

**Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure U-NII** is an FCC regulatory domain for 5 GHz devices that operates over four ranges:
- **U-NII-1**: 5170-5250 MHz
- **U-NII-2**: 5250-5330 MHz
- **U-NII-2 Extended** - 5490-5710 MHz
- **U-NII-3**: 5735-5815 MHz

![](https://i.imgur.com/9pE59zL.png)

## Receiving Wireless Signals

The task of the receiver is just the inverse of a transmitter and is similar to an amplifier that boosts any path loss and reproduces the signal. The first task is to collect the wireless signal from it's antenna, then demodulate and decode the signal. After the original data is recovered, the source signals are reproduced.


**Path Loss** is the reduction in signal power (attenuation) as it propagates between the transmit and receive antennas.

# Wireless AV Solution

## Providing Wireless Access

Having reliable wireless access at home and work seems to only increase the expectation to have it anywhere regardless of the location. This adoption for wireless connectivity has increased the demand for supporting wireless systems by consumers and professional users alike.

Consequentially, where might the greatest demand for providing wireless access in a Pro AV environment? With the proliferation of **Bring Your Own Device** - BYOD, would it be in a meeting room, a facility, an entire campus, or several campus infrastructures? In making the correlation to what users are bringing to their meetings (personal laptops and tablets), it appears more and more meeting rooms need a way for the users of those devices to collaborate.

Whether it's a small space, group of rooms, or areas throughout the facility, there are several benefits to integrating a wireless system with the AV. The first of which is a wireless network's practicality due to the challenges of getting wired signals to the right places.

## Solving Room Challenges

In a wired network where connections are provided at fixed locations, the infrastructure is relatively static, typically consisting of drop points connected to the network backbone. Because of it's static setup, wired networks sometimes do not lend enough flexibility to retrofit certain room environments.

A wireless system can be put in place to overcome some of the following architectural challenges:

- Historic building
- Difficulty with coring or trenching concrete
- Minimal number of floor boxes needed in flex spaces
- Support rooms with movable furniture
- Eliminate video artifacts that result from grounding issues
- Video from stage to tech booth
- Temporary setups in non-traditional presentation spaces such as gymnasiums and cafeterias

## Design Considerations

Wireless networks involve several stages for planning and designing a system. All the possibilities, benefits, and limitations are considered and researched throughout all stages of the design. It’s mainly about understanding the requirements of the wireless system and its intended use.

Below are several guidelines that can be used when designing and determining the requirements for a wireless system:

- Meet with the user and determine requirements
- How will the space be used?
- Where is Wi-Fi needed or not needed?
- Perform a site survey and measure wireless activity with an analyzer
- Determine devices that will be used – Laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.
- The number of devices and users – Will the network be designed for 100 devices or 20,000?
- The applications that will be used – Web access, email, VoIP
- Channels that guests or clients can use
- Coverage vs. Interference
- Point-to-point, point to multi-point, multiple point-to-point
- Primary coverage and minimum signal strength
- Secondary coverage and minimum signal strength
- Minimum data rate
- Overlapping signal channels
- Position of APs to minimize impact

![](https://i.imgur.com/OP213Vo.png)

## Performance Considerations

Several factors can affect the performance of a wireless system - speed/capacity, strength and range. The speed and capacity dictates how much information can be sent certain amount of time. How efficiently the system uses its bandwidth will affect the capacity and speed of the system. 

Other signals or noise may interfere with transmission. Strength describes the receiver's ability to recover the original baseband signal. The amount of separation between the transmitter and receiver is the range. This is impacted by the transmitter output power, receiver sensitivity, bandwidth and frequency.

|**Speed/Capacity**|**Strength**|**Range**|
|---|---|---|
|Bandwidth|Interference|Distance|
|Latency|Distortion|Power Levels|
|Encoding|Signal-to-Noise|Sensitivity|

## Signal Extension

Wireless devices can be used in AV applications to extend signals where wired solutions are not possible or practical, such as portable lecterns, moveable displays, and temporary presentation displays. 

The [Extron eLink 100](https://www.extron.com/product/elink100) is a wireless extender that connects directly to a source device to transmit HDMI video and multi-channel audio up to 100 feet (30 meters) to a receiver that is connected to a display. This extender operates without disrupting other wireless systems in the 5 GHz spectrum to communicate.  
  
The **eLink 100** is HDCP-compliant and extends video source signals with image resolutions up to 1920x1080, including HDTV 1080p/60. To ensure a secure link and reliable operation, AES‑128 encryption, MIMO, AFS, and DFS communication delivers high quality video and audio in real-time.

## Solving Facility Challenges

When establishing or constructing a wireless network in a facility application, here are a few points to consider:

- What are the challenges?
- Who are the users?
- What are the collaboration and instructional settings?
- Is there a mandated device platform? Unrestricted BYOD? Shortlist of approved devices?
- Is there an existing wireless infrastructure? Frequency and channel management? Segmented access?

## Content Sharing

In today's practice of BYOD, sharing content can be difficult. Users that bring a mix of tablets, mobile devices, and laptops require a mix of Apple, Windows and Android device-compatible cables to ensure everyone can share screens or present content. 

This scenario typically involves the wrong cables being available, port connection challenges, or not enough cable to accommodate all attendees. Simply providing wireless content sharing to the space alleviates piles of cables and enables seamless collaboration.

## Screen Mirroring

Screen mirroring requires a sending device and a receiving device that utilize a screen mirroring protocol, such as AirPlay, Google Cast, and MiraCast.

### AirPlay

Developed by Apple, AirPlay allows wireless content streaming from iOS devices to compatible TVs and speakers. As long as the devices are connected to the same wireless network, AirPlay is able to mirror, stream and display audio, videos, photos, desktops and more from an iPhone, iMac, or iPad onto an Apple TV or AirPlay enabled SmartTV

Apple's wireless display standard can send, receive, and display content, but it's limited to Apple devices. For example, AirPlay cannot be used to stream from a Windows laptop.

### Google Cast

With Google Chromecast built-in technology, mobile devices can become personalized remote controls to browse, play and pause multi-screen display content and audio from speakers. With this set up, an app like YouTube or Netflix can be cast from a mobile device to stream video and listen to music, while also multitasking or browsing playlists. 

Chromecast was formerly made available using a wireless dongle that plugged into a display's HDMI port. Since Chromecast built-in has the technology inside, it uses the WiFi capabilities of the smart TV to access the Internet. 

### Miracast

Miracast works similarly to an ad-hoc network by setting up a direct peer-to-peer infrastructure connection via WiFi between a device and the display. This allows Android smartphones or other Windows 10 tablets and laptops to wirelessly mirror their screen contents to Miracast-compatible receivers.

Miracast can be described as "HDMI over Wi-Fi" since it acts like a Wireless HDMI cable to display multimedia between devices.

## Wireless Collaboration

Implementing wireless technology in Pro AV applications has become essential for meeting rooms and education spaces. Now, there are very simple ways for anyone to share content and enable BYOD collaboration without the need for cables.

With the [Extron ShareLink](https://www.extron.com/Collaboration-Systems/prodsubtype-626) Pro collaboration systems, anyone can present wired or wireless content onto the room’s display from their laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

- **ShareLink Pro 1100** – Stream H.264 live media, videos, image content, signage, and share content via a standard web browser.
    
- **ShareLink Pro 500** – Supports an HDMI connection for AV sources up to 4K and a Gigabit Ethernet high-speed data link.

Extron ShareLink Pro facilitates full-screen mirroring for Mac, Apple, Windows, and Android devices with the ability to view up to four pieces of content simultaneously.
