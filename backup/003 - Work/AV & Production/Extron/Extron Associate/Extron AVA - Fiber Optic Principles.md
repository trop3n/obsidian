## Introduction

With several billion kilometers deployed around the world, optical fiber has become the backbone of the most advanced data networks and communication systems. In today's AV systems, fiber optic technology has emerged as a standard cabling infrastructure to support high resolution video, audio and control signals.

## What is Fiber Optics?

It may be surprising, but the methods for using light waves to transmit signals is well over a century old. However, the foundation for modern techniques of transmitting light energy was established in the 1960's, when lasers were first demonstrated. Soon thereafter, the first optical fibers were produced in the 1970's. 

In AV technology, we are accustomed to information travelling in different ways, so that various applications and devices can communicate. "Fiber Optics" refers to the technology of transmitting information using pulses of light, in place of electricity, to transmit signals.

Audio, video, and data signals are guided down glass or plastic fibers from a light transmitter to a receiver. The properties of the fiber allow the signals to reach their destination with minimal signal loss or degradation, and without ground loop hums or electrical interference. 
## Fiber Optic Applications

Today, fiber optics is either the dominant medium or a logical choice for almost every expansive communication system. The content is secure and immune to outside interference, and is preferred in government, military and medical applications. In addition, the backbone infrastructures for telephone services, cellular networks, cable television - CATV, and the Internet were either built on or replaced by fiber.
## Fiber-Based Communication

Fiber-based communication services are easily brought to our neighborhoods, multi-level buildings, facilities and campuses via fiber to the location referred to as X. FTTX is a collective term for all possible fiber topologies from the phone, cable or internet carrier to it's customers, based on the location of the fiber's termination point. For example:

- FTTC - Fiber to the Curb
- Fiber to the neighborhood/node - FTTN
- Fiber to the Home - FTTH
- Fiber to the Premises - FTTP
- Fiber to the Building - FTTB
## Fiber Optics in AV

In AV applications, fiber optics are used where distance, signal integrity, or image quality is a factor. These environments typically include office buildings, universities, hospitals, stadiums, airports, where the fiber's extremely high bandwidth capabilities can support today's requirements of multi-gigabit data rates and high video resolutions, such as 4K. 

The infrastructure is often a hybrid topology, combining multiple configurations of sources, displays, and their connections into a single system. The same familiar functions available in the various AV devices, such as extenders, distribution amplifiers, switchers and matrix switchers, are also included in fiber optic systems. The main difference is that the AV and control signals are converted to light pulses for transmission over fiber optic cabling.
## Properties of Light

A primary characteristic of light is color. Visible light is an electromagnetic wave, consisting of oscillating electrostatic and magnetic fields travelling through space. The frequency of the wave determines it's color.

After years of research, scientists discovered each color of light has it's own wavelength (expressed in nanometers) and frequency (expressed in Hz or cycles per second). For instance, red light has a longer wavelength and lower frequency than blue light. Blue light has a short wavelength and high frequency. Green light is near the middle of the visible spectrum. 
### Sources of Light

The light source for fiber optics use a transmitter that rapidly modulates the light signals on and off while projecting the microscopic beam of light. There are two types of light sources. 
#### LED

A ***Light Emitting Diode - LED*** produces a light output when electrical current passes through it. The light from an LED has a low power output, and wide spectral width that radiates out in all directions, like a light bulb. 

LEDs can emit light from the surface or edge and are only used in short-distance multimode systems at 850nm or 1300nm. It's low bandwidth limits the maximum data rate to well under 1 Gbps.
#### Laser Diode

A ***Laser Diode*** is an optical source that generates clear light within a narrow band of wavelengths.

Multimode systems use *Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers - VCSELs* which are high-speed lasers that emit from the surface at 850nm. 

The following edge emitting laser diodes are primarily used in singlemode systems:

- **Fabry-Perot Laser - FP**: Uses semitransparent mirrors to create a horizontal laser that operates at 1310nm for distances up to 30km.
- **Distributed Feedback Laser**: Operates at 1310nm or 1550 nm for distances up to 100km and beyond.
## Bandwidth

The speed at which data can be transmitted over a medium from one device to another in bits per seconds is the ***data rate.*** Bandwidth is the data rate at which a fiber system operates, which is the amount of signal that can transit through fiber. Higher bandwidth means more data per second; lower bandwidth is less signal data.

- **Ethernet**: 10Base-T – 10 Mbps
- **Fast Ethernet**: 100Base-T – 100 Mbps
- **Gigabit Ethernet**: 1000Base-T – 1 Gbps (1,000 Mbps)
- **10G Ethernet**: 10GBase-T – 10 Gbps (10,000 Mbps)

## Fiber Optic vs. Twisted Pair

Fiber has several advantages over twisted pair copper wire, making it a more desirable and cost-effective solution for some applications. Fiber can transmit more information over longer distances in less time than any other communication medium. 

The bandwidth and distance capability of fiber means that fewer cables are needed, fewer repeaters, less power, less interference, less noise, less errors and less maintenance. 

- **Longer Distance Capability**: Fiber cable can be run over a longer distance without adding special equipment.
- **Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference** (EMI): Useful in environments where machinery or electrical signals tend to generate high levels of noise.
- **Minimal Data Errors**: Optical fiber has a much lower bit error rate that reduces the occurrences of retransmissions, thereby increasing network efficiency.

## Light Interaction with Objects

In fiber optics, the transmission of light is a modulated into pulses. As a series of light pulses are transmitted, the stream of ones and zeros form a digital communication channel. The data is represented as the laser switches between two intensity values, the high value is a **one**, and the low value is a **zero**. 

There are however, conditions that limit a fiber's bandwidth and signal strength. When a lightwave strikes an object, several things can happen. The way light interacts with an object is dependent upon the frequency of the light and the nature of the object. 
### Absorption

***Absorption*** is caused when a light wave of a given frequency strikes a material with molecular structures of the same resonant frequency, converting light energy into heat as it interacts with the material. In case of fiber optic transmission, absorption is generally caused by impurities or defects in the fiber.
### Refraction

***Refraction*** is the bend or change in direction of light as it passes from one medium to another. As light travels through different medium, the velocity changes. 

For example, when light travels from air into water, it slows down, causing the light to bend and travel at a different angle or direction.
### Reflection

***Reflection*** occurs when a light wave encounters a surface that does not absorb the energy, such that the light wave returns into the original medium. In fiber transmission, this effect is used to confine light so that it travels through the core, bouncing back and forth off the surrounding surfaces of the cladding. When the angle at which the light strikes the cladding is low enough, all of the the light is reflected back into the core. 

This is referred to as ***Total Internal Reflection***. 

***Bend Radius*** is the minimum radius at which an optical fiber cable can be bent without introducing attenuation or damage to the fiber. 
### Scattering

***Scattering*** is caused when a light signal collides with a very small particle or impurity in the glass, knocking it off course in all directions. The amount of scattering depends on how big the particle is compared to the wavelength of light. 
### Dispersion

**Dispersion** refers to the spreading out of a light pulse as it propagates down the fiber. The two main types of dispersion are modal (path) and chromatic (color). 

- **Modal Dispersion***: As light enters multimode fiber at different angles and takes multiple paths, the light signals tend to arrive at various times. When each light pulse spreads out, signal overlapping can occur causing the signals to be obscured. Singlemode fiber only allows light to travel down a single path, so modal dispersion does not occur.
- **Chromatic Dispersion**: As different color components in a light beam travel down the fiber, each of the wavelengths arrive at slightly different times. This results in a spreading of the digital transmission pulse, thus distorting the signal. 
### Attenuation

***Attenuation*** in fiber optics is the loss of signal power over the length of the cable, due to the quality of the glass, absorption, scattering, or excessive bending within the fiber. The attenuation properties, measured in decibels (dB), are determined from the ratio of the input light power to the output light power at the far end of the fiber. Signal loss can also be attributed to optical components such as connectors, splices and splitters.
## Termination Procedures

In a fiber system, there are two types of termination procedures. 

- **Connectors**: Joining two fibers to create a temporary joint or connect the cable to a device.
- **Splices**: Creating a permanent joint between the ends of two fibers by mechanically joining them or fusing together with heat. 

To ensure both termination methods provide a strong reliable connection with minimal signal loss and reflection, the two fiber cores should be identical, perfectly aligned, properly finishes, compatible with the equipment and protected against the environment in which they are installed.
## Types of Connectors

With fiber optic cable installation, the way cables are attached to the system is vital to the success of its operation. To assist with a clean alignment with the transmitter or receiver, each connector has a long thin cylindrical tube called a ferrule. Below are the more common types of connectors used in fiber optic systems.

- **Straight Tipe - ST**: Has a twist lock bayonet mount similar to a BNC with a ferrule of 2.5mm. These are typically used in high security or military applications. 
- **Ferrule Connector - FC**: Similar to the ST connector but uses a threaded screw on mount 2.5mm ferrule instead of the bayonet lock. These are most often used for singlemode applications.
- **Subscriber Connector - SC**: features a snap-in coupling with a simple-push-pull motion for the 2.5mm ferrule. These are commonly used in data communication applications such as, CATV, LAN, and WAN applications.
- **Lucent Connector - LC**: Used for high density applications with a smaller 1.25mm ferrule. LC connector are replacing the SC style connector due to the smaller size and are used with Extron fiber optic systems.
- **Multifiber Push-On / MPO / Mechanical Transfer Push-On MTP**: Used for very high density applications with up to 24 fibers per connector. They are used in high speed networks to achieve up to 100 Gbps data rates using parallel fibers. They are also used in fiber optic trunk cables to reduce the size of patch panels. 
## Signal Output

When light arrives at the receiver, it detects the light using an electricl component known as photodiode. Through circuitry in the receiver, the light is converted back into an electrical signal and delivered to an output device. In AV, high resolution video signals are sent to projectors or monitors, audio goes into the sound system processing, and control signals are carried through for device power on or off, source switching, lighting, volume settings, etc.
# Elements of Fiber Optic Cable

## Parts of a Cable

The basic structure of an optical fiber consists of three parts.

- **Core**: The center part of the glass fiber that carries the light pulses
- **Cladding**: Surrounds the core to cause reflection, keeping the light from escaping and travelling down the fiber core
- **Buffer**: The outer coating made of a polymer material that protects the glass fiber.
## Measuring Fiber Optic Cable

Fiber optic are measured in meters(m), as the transmission distances within a fiber optic system can carry light information over 30 kilometers (km), or 18.75 miles. 

### Microns

***Microns*** (μ) are equivalent to one millionth of a meter (μm) and are used in measuring the diameter of a fiber optic cable's core and cladding. When referring to 9/125, 50/125 and 62.5/125, the first set of numbers (9, 50 and 62.5) are the diameter of the fiber core. The second number (125) is the outside diameter of the fiber cladding.
### Nanometer

***Nanometers*** (nm) are equivalent to one billionth of a meter and are used to measure the wavelength of light. Our eyes are sensitive to light in the "visible spectrum" of 400nm to 700nm, from violet to red. Fiber optics use light in the "infrared spectrum" which has wavelengths typically around 850, 1300 and 1550 and 1625 nm.
## The Fiber Core

Fiber can be identified by the type of paths that the light rays, or modes, travel within the fiber core. There are two basic types, Singlemode and Multimode. 
### Singlemode

***Singlemode*** fiber optic cable has a small core diameter designed to carry one mode of light. This allows the number of light reflections in the core to decrease, lowering attenuation and creating the ability for the signal to travel further. 

The core of singlemode fiber is typically 8 to 10 microns (μm) in diameter, and able to operate at 40 Gbps. These transmission signals commonly use laser with wavelengths of 1310, 1550 and 1625 nanometers (nm) in long distance, higher bandwidth runs.
### Multimode

With a larger core diameter of 50 μm or 62.5 μm, fibers that carry more than on transmission path or "mode" are referred to as **Multimode** fibers. This results in the number of light reflections within the core to increase, causing a higher dispersion and attenuation rate that reduces signal quality over long distances. Multimode light signals operate at data rates up to 10 Gbps over distances to 600m, with wavelengths of 850 nm and 1300 nm for short distance data applications.

There are two types of multimode fibers where the changes in refraction between the core and the cladding values. 

- ***Step Index***: As rays of light enter the fiber at different angles, those with a shallow angle travel a more direct route and arrive sooner than those with steeper angles that reflect off the cladding. Since each signal path is different, they arrive at different times. However, the need to leave spacing between pulses to prevent overlapping limits the amount of information that can be sent.
- ***Graded Index***: The light slightly bends and follows a spiral path rather than zig-zagging off the cladding, reducing it's travel distance. The shortened path and the higher speed allows light to arrive with less dispersion.
## Cable Construction

There are many factors to consider for fiber optic cables, such as tensile strength, flexibility, and temperature range. The material of the fiber core is typically made of either plastic or glass. 

- ***Plastic Optical Fiber***: Made of plastic that comprises of acrylic as the core and polymers as the cladding material. Plastic fiber is a larger core multimode fiber that is lightweight and flexible for limited bandwidth, low speed, short run applications. The optical fibers can be simply cut with scissors. 
- ***Glass Optical Fiber***: A delicate type of optical fiber glass that is more versatile with a mix of configurations, connector fittings, adapter types, and ideal for harsh environments. When exposed to mechanical stress, high temperatures or chemical substances, it performs at normal operation.
## Cable Types

Fiber optic "cable" refers to the complete assembly of fibers, other internal parts like buffer tubes, ripcords, stiffeners, and strength members inside the protective jacket. To isolate the fiber from external forces, there are different types of protection depending on the number of fibers and how and where it will be installed. 

***Tight Buffered*** - used indoors where flexibility and ease of termination are important. A soft buffer coating surrounds the cladding for protection and color-coded identification.

- ***SImplex*** cables consist of a single strand of glass or plastic fiber, where only a single transmit and receive line is required between devices or when bi-directional communication is used.
- ***Duplex*** cables consist of two strands of glass or plastic fiber for communication between devices where separate transmit and receive signals are required.
- ***Distribution***: cables are small and lightweight that contain several simplex fibers bundled in the same jacket with the a strength member, or sometimes fiberglass rods to prevent bundling.
- ***Breakout*** cables are strong and rugged that contain several simplex cables bundled inside a common jacket with strength members around each fiber. 

***Loose Tube*** - used outdoors to withstand rough handling, weather, aerial, underground and ducted applications. The fiber is encased within a loose tube buffer filled with moisture blocking materials, then covered by a protective outer jacket. 
# Solutions and Standards

It is important to understand that eye damage from working with fiber optic laser light is a big concern. Even though the light sources are generally low power levels and are infrared (below the visible spectrum), NEVER look into a fiber. A power meter can be used to check signals, power levels and wavelengths. 

Also, be careful with the small glass shards that are cleaved off the ends of the fibers being terminated or spliced. They are extremely sharp and can easily penetrate the skin. Always wear safety glasses and protective clothing whenever working with fiber and carefully dispose of all fiber scraps in an approved manner.

***Cleaving*** is the process of cutting the end of an optical fiber after it has been scored or scribed using a cleave or scribe tool. The cut is made at a 90-degree angle to the fiber. 

## Additional Considerations

Fiber optic cables do not normally involve electrical hazards, unless they are in close proximity to electrical and conductive cables. Then, there is always a potential shock hazard. It is recommended to become familiar with the National Electrical Code - **NEC** and their safety practices before handling electrical components. 

Fiber optic splicing and termination processes should include the use of various chemical cleaners, solvents, and adhesives. Safe handling procedures for these flammable substances should be carefully observed. When using fusion splicers that use an electric arc to make splices, care should be taken to ensure no flammable gasses are present in the space.
