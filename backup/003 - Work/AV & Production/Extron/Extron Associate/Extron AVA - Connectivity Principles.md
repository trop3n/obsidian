## Cable Basics

A cable's essential function is to carry signals from one point to another. With such a simple purpose, they are often overlooked component in an AV system and **can be the weakest link in a signal chain**.

Remember, not all cables are manufactured the same. If poor quality cables are used, it can negatively impact an entire system. To achieve the best possible solution, it is important to understand the various cables and their associated specifications.

## Components of a Cable

Cables are available in many forms and made from different materials. The inner components and construction of traditional copper cabling are important for its performance. As the terms wire and cable are often interchanged, each has a distinct meaning.

- **Wire** - Contains only one conductor that may either be solid or made up of numerous strands.
- **Cable** - Contains any number of insulated wires in a protected bundle. It is the result of combining two or more wires in a manner that conforms to certain standards.

### Core Conductor

The center conductor of a cable is made of a highly conductive material which carries electrical current. The most commonly used is copper, die to its overall conductive properties and availability. Other materials such as aluminum, silver, nickel and tin are also used in various applications. The following are two types of wire core. 

- **Solid**: Made of one single wire and generally provides excellent conductivity. These conductors are form able but not very flexible for use in permanent installations.
- **Stranded**: Comprised of multiple small gauge wires that are twisted together to form a larger slide conductor. The increased flexibility is easy to work with and found in applications where the wire is able to move.

The conductor size is listed as American Wire Gauge - AWG or Standard Wire Gauge - SWG, and determines the measured diameter of the conductor. The size has an impact on the amount of electrical current and resistance a cable will have listed in their specification. 

For example, AWG 24 has a diameter of .0201 and a resistance of 25.67 ohms per 1,000 feet. Thicker wires have lower gauge numbers, compared to thinner wires with a high gauge number.
### Insulation

The cable insulation is the non-conductive material that covers the actual wire to separate it from neighboring conductors. The insulation helps to minimize signal loss, maintain signal flow, avoid wire contact with other conductors, prevent leaking current, and guard against interference. 

Insulation varies by the type of material used, whether it is foamed or solid. These factors influence the flexibility, voltage rating, and ease of termination. The more common insulation materials include plastic, nylon, rubber, silicone, fiberglass, and fluoropolymer.
### Shield

The layer between the cable’s insulation and jacket is the shield. It acts as a return path for signal grounding and protects from outside interference. Typically made of copper or aluminum, the following shielding methods are available.

- **Foil Shield** – A thin layer of copper or aluminum wrapped completely around the insulation of the inner core conductors that protects the signal from picking up Radio Frequency Interference – RFI.
- **Braid Shield** – Many fine strands of material woven together to form a braid that encompasses the insulation of the inner wires. It keeps unwanted Electromagnetic Interference – EMI from affecting signal integrity.

Wire pairs can be foil shielded, braided or combination of both. However, some cables do not contain any type of shielding.
### Jacket

The outer jacket provides the overall protection to the inner components. Made of plastic or a rubber mylar, it protects against weather, liquids, chemicals, etc. A low friction and flexible jacket also assists during installation, making it easier to pull through conduit or cable trays. Depending on the environment, the cable may need to conform to industry standards in order to be installed.
## Important Characteristics

Careful attention should be made to a cable's specifications, as they are a key indicator of how well a given cable will perform in a system. Voltage drops through incorrectly specified cables are common reasons for system faults. So, be sure to check the cable ratings when factoring maximum cable resolution, bandwidth, and distance. The following are some of the more important specifications for cables.
### Resistance

**Resistance** limits the flow of electrical current and result sin the dissipation of power. Cable resistance is measured in ohms per unit length (1,000 feet or 1,000 meters). This is determined by cable material type, size and temperature. An example specification may read, 41 ohms/1,00ft, or 135 ohms/1km. Long cable runs or cables with high resistance values can negatively impact signal levels.
### Capacitance

**Capacitance** determines how much a cable can hold an electrical charge, expressed in picofarads per foot (pF/ft). When supplying electrical energy, a cable with a high capacitance slows down the signal voltage and interferes with transmission. The lower the capacitance of the cable, the better it performs at higher frequencies. 
### Impedance

**Impedance** is the opposition to the flow of electrical current. Specifically, it is the cumulative effect of resistance and capacitance, measured in ohms. Cable and equipment have defined impedance values and it is important that they match. Mismatches in the type of interface connectors, components, or cables can cause reflections, return loss, and data errors.

**Return Loss** is the *measured amount of signal (in dB) that is reflected back to the source when impedance is not maintained.*
### Attenuation

**Attenuation** is a measurement, in decibels (dB) of the amount of any reduction in signal strength or loss, due to the natural consequence of transmission over long distances. Loss can also occur through passive media components, such as cable adapters, splices and connectors.

Cable attenuation has three variables:

- Amount of loss
- Frequency where loss is measured
- Distance or length of cable
### Data Rate

**Data Rate** is the transmission speed at which data is transferred, specified in bits per second and typically abbreviated as Mbps or Gbps. Another term for the data transfer rate is **throughput**.

Be aware that there are differences between maximum and actual speed ratings for cable. The actual performance depends on many factors, such as number of connections, hops through devices, traffic and interference. It is possible for a cable to achieve close to maximum data rates, however the application and communication condictiones must be optimal. 
## Cable Quality

The way that a cable performs in a system is largely determined by its physical construction. While the following factors are related to the physical cable,. they have a large effect on signal integrity.
### Interference

**Intereference** can occur as a result of many factors. If a cable is poorly constructed, not properly shielded, or installed incorrectly, outside interference can cause it to behave like a large antenna instead of what it was designed for.

The prime culprit of signal interference is RFI and EMI. Foil shields are used to prevent high frequency RFI from radio frequency transmissions, while braided shields are used to prevent EMI, caused by magnetic fields from larger machinery near the cable.
### Crosstalk

**Crosstalk** is a type of interference created internally within the cable by signals running in close proximity to one another. Crosstalk occurs when data that is being sent down one line carries over and adds itself to the signal of the cable that is next to it.
### Cable Length

Physics dictates that when **Cable Length** is increased, performance decreases. As signals travel down a cable, the more material passes through, weakening the signal. The effect of a weaker signal is a loss of image brightness and detail.
### Frequency

**Frequency** is defined as the rate of repetition of a regular event, expressed in Hertz (Hz) where 1 Hz equals one cycle per second. As a signal's frequency increases, cable capacitance and conductor materials become integral factors in determining overall quality. Reflection problems and fuzzy images may be experienced when a cable is not able to support the demands placed upon it be a high-frequency signal.

# Cables and Connectors

## Basic Cables

With so many types of cables that exist, it could easily become confusing trying to select which is the most appropriate for the application. Most cables used in the AV industry vary greatly in size, capability, quality and performance, an fall within four main groups:

### Coaxial

**Coaxial** cables consists of a center conductor that carries the signal, while an outer conductor or shield, provides a return path for ground current. The two conductors are separated by an insulating material called a **dielectric**, providing physical protection to the copper core. All of these components are jacketed to make one cable.

Coaxial cable is used for radio frequency signals in applications that include feedlines connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas, computer networks, digital audio (S/PDIF), and distributing cable television signals. Coax can run at a maximum of 1640 feet (500 meters), carry high bandwidth signals, and provide good EMI and RFI protection.

### Twisted Pair

**Twisted Pair** cables can distribute video, audio and control signals up to 330 feet (100 meters), or further if networked. They are comprised of two individual conductors that have been twisted together. In a four pair cable, there will be a total of eight solid wires, all connected to an RJ-45 connector.  
  
Unwanted signals induced into adjacent conductors causes crosstalk interference and noise. Rather than running the cable pairs in parallel, twisting them is a way to make each conductor cancel out the magnetic field it generates around itself. The equal and opposite signals prevent each conductor from inducing a signal into adjacent conductors of that cable.

There are two main categories of twisted pair cable.

- **Unshielded Twisted Pair – UTP** cables with color coded insulators and no additional shielding like meshes or foil. Most commonly seen in telecommunications and computer networking environments.
    
- **Shielded Twisted Pair – STP** cables with color coded insulators surrounded by a foil shield, a wire braid mesh, or a combination of the two for protection against interference.

### Fiber Optic

**Fiber Optic** is an ideal signal transmission method for distances up to 30km (18.75 miles). This is due to the extremely low attenuation characteristics when transmitting light versus electricity.

The electrical energy from the source device is converted into light energy via a transmitter. A laser diode then injects this light energy into the fiber optic core. The core is a strand of glass or plastics wrapped with a cladding material, which is equivalent of a mirror on the inside. The internal reflection causes light signals to propagate to the end of the cable, where it is converted back to electrical energy by a receiver.

The core and cladding are covered by a protective coating that provides added strength. Finally, there is an outer jacket for additional strength and protection.

### Hybrid Cables

**Hybrid Cables** are available in multiple sizes with different types of components and conductors that are incorporated into a single cable. For example, fiber can be used for the video portion of the HDMI signal, and copper would be used for power and bidirectional communication.

The [Extron HD Pro Plenum Series](https://www.extron.com/product/hdproplenum) are a hybrid optical-copper cable for high-speed transmission of HDMI digital video and audio signals. These cables conform to Premium High Speed HDMI Cable performance standards and support data rates up to 18 Gbps, video resolutions up to 4K/60 @ 4:4:4, HDR, EDID, HDCP, and CEC.
## What are Connectors?

Audio, Video, and Control connectors consist of plugs (male-ended) and jacks (female-ended) for attaching cables between devices. The connection may require a tool for assembly and removal, be used temporarily for portable equipment, or installed semi-permanently. Connectors are attached to cables either by twisting or locking (BNC); threading (F connection); a screw or snap down lock (DVI or barrier strip); or by contact pressure (RCA or HDMI).  
  
Quality connectors are able to withstand connecting and disconnecting, as well as movement, and vibration. Poorly installed connectors can create intermittent contact causing electrical noise that will degrade an entire system. A connector must maintain the shielding and cancellation designed into a cable by carrying that noise protection through to the connector.
## Cable and Connector Matching

The signal integrity running through a cable must also be maintained through any connections in the signal chain. Impedance mismatches between cables, connectors and devices can cause attenuation, distortion and transmission errors via signal reflections, where the original signal is reflected back to the source, similar to an echo.

A single instance of impedance mismatching may not be noticeable, but multiple mismatches in the signal chain can have a cumulative effect on the signal's integrity.
## Reducing Interference in Analog Audio Signals

**Unbalanced** signal cables have two conductor wires. One wire carries the analog audio signal and is referred to as *hot*. The other is the ground wire, also called earth, or shield. These are acceptable for short runs, but can be susceptible to audio interference, causing noise.

**Balanced cables** contain three wires. One hot wire carries the analog audio signal and one cold wire carries the audio signal in the opposite, or reverse polarity. This in-phase, out-of-phase effect sends positive and negative signals equally to cancel noise and interference. The third wire is the ground shield.
## Analog Audio Connectors

Audio cables are available with a variety of connectors for different applications. Understanding the differences between various analog inputs and outputs helps to keep the sound clean, and free of signal loss and noise. Let's take a look at the connector types commonly used for analog audio.
### Unbalanced Audio

Unbalanced audio cables are terminated with these connector plugs and jacks:

- RCA jack with Left (white) and Right (red) - A simple push-on connector with a solid center pin and an outside sleeve.

- Captive screw (Phoenix, Terminal Block) - Using a screw the securely hold down the stripped wire end into place, captive screw connectors can be used for unbalanced audio signals or for control signals.
## Digital Audio Connectors

Unlike analog audio cables, which use separate conductors for each channel, multiple channels of digital audio can be passed through a single cable. The following connectors support various digital cable types.
### AES3

AES3 are balanced, 110 ohm interfaces that support the transmission of digital audio signals with the following types of connectors:
- XLR - 3 to 7 pins with a outer shell for shielding and locking. It is designed for high reliability in professional audio and stage lighting equipment. 
- BNC - Using a twist connection with a bayonet lock, BNC connectors provide a tight connection and a suitable bandwidth for digital audio signals over coaxial cable.
### S/PDIF

The Sony/Philips Digital Interface transmits digital audio using either coaxial or optical cabling.
- S/PDIF - the coaxial connection is a digital audio connector that is usually orange, making it easier to differentiate from other RCA connections.
- TOSLINK - a fiber optic connection that uses a square connector (Toshiba Link)
## Analog Video Connectors

### Composite

**Composite** video interfaces deliver standard definition video at 480i or 576i resolution. A single conductor carries the complete video for chroma and luma into one channel.
### S-Video

**S-Video** uses a Mini-DIN connector for analog video at 480i or 576i resolution. Analog color video signals may be carried in separate channels that contain luminance (Y) and chrominance (C).
### Component

**Component** is analog video information that is transmitted or stored as three separate signals at 480i, 576i, or HD video up to 1080p resolution. YPbPr separates the brightness and color into three signals:

- Y – Carries Luminance (brightness) and the sync signal
    
- Pb – Carries the difference between blue and luma
    
- Pr – Caries the difference between red and luma
### VGA

**Video Graphics Array – VGA** uses a DB-15 connector that were commonly found on computers to support VGA display resolutions up to1920x1080 and higher. The signal is typically RGB with separate Horizontal (H) and Vertical (V) sync.

## Digital Video Connectors

### DVI

**Digital Visual Interface – DVI** is a digital connector used for video sources and displays, primarily for computers and computer displays. The various DVI interfaces include:

- DVI-A carries analog signals up to 1920x1080p/60
- DVI-D carries digital signals
    
    - Single link – up to 1920x1200 @ 60Hz and 1080p/60
    - Dual link – up to 2560x1600 @ 60Hz

**DisplayPort** is a digital-only video transmission interface used to connect video sources to a computer monitor for 8K/60 and 4K/120 at 32.4 Gbps. It can also be used to carry audio, USB, and other forms of data.

### Fiber

With fiber optic installation, the way cables are attached to the system is vital to the success of its operation. Below are the more common types of connectors used in fiber optic systems.

- **Straight Tip – ST** – Has a twist lock bayonet mount similar to a BNC with a ferrule of 2.5 mm. These are typically used in high security or military applications.
    
- **Ferrule Connection – FC** – Similar to the ST connector but uses a threaded screw-on mount 2.5 mm ferrule instead of the bayonet lock. These are most often used for singlemode applications.
    
- **Subscriber Connector – SC** – Features a snap-in coupling with a simple push-pull motion for the 2.5 mm ferrule. These are commonly used in data communication applications such as, CATV, LAN, and WAN applications.
    
- **Lucent Connector – LC** – Used for high density applications with a smaller 1.25 mm ferrule. LC connectors are replacing the SC style connector due to the smaller size and are used with Extron fiber optic systems.
    
- **Multifiber Push-On – MPO / Mechanical Transfer Push-On – MTP** – Used for very high-density applications with up to 24 fibers per connector. They are used in high-speed networks to achieve up to 100 Gbps data rates using parallel fibers. They are also used in fiber optic trunk cables to reduce the size of patch panels.
### RJ-45

**Registered Jack-45 –** **RJ-45** connectors hold up to eight wires for twisted pair cable. These 8 position 8 contact – 8P8C modular connectors are used for Ethernet and HDBaseT systems. HDBaseT is a connectivity standard for transmitting uncompressed high-definition video, audio, power, networking, Ethernet, USB, and control signals over a single category cable.  
  
Extron offers a range of HDBaseT-compatible devices, as well as proprietary XTP and DTP extenders and switchers that deliver multiple signals over standard shielded CATx twisted pair cable across extended distances. Learn more on how HDBaseT simplifies connectivity here, [Extron HDBaseT Products](https://www.extron.com/company/article.aspx?id=hdbaset).
### USB

**Universal Serial Bus – USB** is a multipurpose connector for various peripheral devices such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, scanner, or flash drive to communicate with a computer. It has largely replaced a variety of interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as for power to charge portable devices.  
  
There are a variety of different USB connectors, including Type A, Type B, Type C, Mini, and Micro. USB Type-C is a slim, reversible connector used for transferring high-bandwidth video, audio, data, and power between laptops, smartphones, and tablets.  
  
With the combination of data transfer and communications capability, along with power delivery and AV, the USB-C connector is becoming a widely used connector on many computers.
# Cable Termination and Routing

Cable termination is the connection of the wire to a connector, which allows for connecting to other cables or devices. Proper cable termination practices are vital for the complete and accurate transfer of analog and digital information. This refers to ending a transmission line with a device that matches the impedance of the equipment generating the signal and preventing a signal mismatch from reflecting back toward the source.  
  
Connector terminations must physically match the signal and cable to ensure optimal signal transfer. For DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort connections, the precision and accuracy required for these high resolution signals make it difficult to successfully terminate these connectors. So, these cables are typically pre-terminated, or pre-built.
## Cable Preparation

To ensure that the job is done properly, it is best to develop a strategy from beginning to end and make careful preparations before the cable termination process takes place.

- Confirm proper tools are used to complete the job
    
- Determine where the termination point is located
    
- Route and organize cables in bundles by destination
    
- Cut cables the same length, especially if each carries the same video information
    
- Removal of jacket and any insulation to expose the conductor and prepare the cable ends for the connector
    
- Dedicate rack space and patch panels to accommodate clean cable management
    
- Leave enough slack in case there is a need to re-terminate
    
- Properly identify and label all terminations
## Terminating a Cable

For the various cable and wire types, whether its twisted pair, coaxial, or fiber, there are several steps to take and different tools to use for cable cutting, sheath removal, punch down, and crimping.  
  
The [Extron XTP DTP 24 Punch Down Jack](https://www.extron.com/product/xtpdtp24punchdown) is a shielded RJ-45 keystone jack for use with Extron XTP DTP 24 shielded twisted pair cable. The jack is fully shielded for use in high EMI/RFI environments where signal integrity is critical. The keystone style snap-in design enables easy installation in wallplates, AAP - Architectural Adapter Plates, and similar mounting frames. The punch down tool firmly secures the wire into the jack for quick and easy termination.  
  
The [Extron CTU 45](https://www.extron.com/product/ctu45) is a crimp tool for terminating Extron XTP DTP 24 shielded twisted pair cables with Extron XTP DTP 24 Plugs. The crimp die provides accurate and consistent crimp connections in a single cycle, as it simultaneously crimps the plug contacts and the metal strain relief.
## Cable Run Guidelines

During the stages of an AV system design, ample time should be given to examine the physical environment or site plans for device locations and cable runs. Distance calculations should be made for all signal types from the different sources and destinations, as each has their own limitations.  
  
For example, the maximum distance for HDBaseT systems is 330 feet (100 meters) from the transmitter to the receiver. For twisted pair infrastructures, it is recommended to use shielded category cabling. For fiber optic cable, signal transmission can carry light information over 30 kilometers (18.75 miles).  
  
All of the specifications for bandwidth, impedance, and maximum pulling tension per cable diameter should be identified, and be cautious with conduit, loops, bends, and kinks during the install.
## Cable Safety Requirements

A cable is more than just copper or fiber and the connector. Special consideration must be taken when routing cable through a building's air handling space, which requires safety standards for smoke, air and heat resistance. So, a very important piece of the cable's construction s the jacket which can have several options depending on where it's installed.
### General Purpose

**Communications Multipurpose** (CM) is the most basic cable jacket rating specified by the National Electric Code - NEC. CM cable is designed for general use in cases where the fire code does not place any restrictions on the cable type. The minimum jacket ratings are suitable for in-wall installations inside a residence or a single-story building, but not for use between floors and air handling spaces.

As with any in-wall rated cable, the goal is to prevent fire from travelling along a cable from one part of a building to another. Cables that are rated "Type CM" must pass a standard flammability test, where they don't ordinarily spread flames more than eight feet. These general purpose cables with a CL2 and CL3 ratings refer to the amount of voltage they can carry (CL2-150 volts, CL3-300 volts).
### Riser

**Communications Multipurpose Riser – CMR** cable is suitable for installation in the vertical shafts between the floors of a building where conduits, cables and pipes are installed to run power, low-voltage wiring, and other utilities. The flammability requirements for type CMR cables are stricter than Type CM cables, and are to be flame-retardant enough to prevent the spread of a fire from one floor to another. 

Cables that are labeled "Type CMR" must pass a standardized flammability test to self-extinguish and prevent the flame from travelling up the cable in a vertical burn test. CL2R and CL3R are the riser versions of CL2 and CL3.
### Plenum

**Communications Multipurpose Plenum – CMP** cable is used in the building space where air ducts are connected for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The flammability requirements for Type CMP cables are stricter than Type CM and CMR cables.

Cables that are labelled "Type CMR" must pass a standardized flammability test. Because air travels via these plenum spaces, it is critical that cables to no give off toxic smoke if they burn. Plenum-rated cables not only have special fire-resistant jackets, but they also use special compounds in the insulation material that provides for low flame, and less smoke output or toxic gas if the cable is burned. CL2P and CL3P are the plenum versions of CL2 and CL3.
### Fiber

There are two types of fiber optic cables that are installed in buildings.  
  
**Optical Fiber Nonconductive Plenum – OFNP** cables are the highest fire rated fiber cable with fire-resistance and low smoke. OFNP cables contain only glass fibers with no copper conductive elements, and are intended for horizontal runs within an air handling conduit.  
  
**Optical Fiber Nonconductive Riser – OFNR** cables have fiber-resistance and low smoke production characteristics, but are not as highly rated as OFNP. OFNR cables contain only glass fiber with no copper conductive elements, and are intended for vertical runs between floors as part of a fiber backbone.
### Halogen-Free

**Low Smoke, Zero Halogen – LSZH** cables use a halogen-free jacket material that meets European safety requirements for flame, smoke, and corrosive testing. LSZH cables are used in areas that are not able to be ventilated sufficiently such as aircraft, aboard ships, the railroad industry, or any other enclosed space where people or equipment would be harmed if exposed to toxic smoke or fumes.  
  
Halogen in cable jackets is a good flame retardant, but emits toxic fumes and smoke when exposed to a flame that can create acid when exposed to moisture. Commonly used in Europe, these cables limit the emission of smoke and corrosive gases and permits no halogens to be released when exposed to high heat or flames.
## Optimal Performance

For optimal performance, ensure the entire cabling infrastructure meets the equipment, site, and any city ordinances.

- Keep cable runs as short as possible
    
- Cables should not be pulled too tight or stretched
    
- Avoid sharp corners by using gentle bends
    
- Use hooks and loop velcro fasteners, not cable zip ties
    
- Minimize patch panels and patch cables
    
- Avoid parallel runs with power cables or adjacent runs to electrical mains
    
- Cables should not suspend from ceiling
    
- Shielded CAT6a is required for all HDBaseT environments
    
- Use plenum-rated cabling in areas that facilitate air circulation for HVAC systems

## Factors for Poor Signal Performance

The following are possible contributing factors to poor signal performance:

- Ground loop – Occurs when there is a potential voltage difference between various grounding points. The duplicate ground paths form a loop which picks up currents that cause a hum or buzz.
    
- Interference from alien crosstalk – Signal from one pair of wires picked up by adjacent pair
    
    - **Near End Crosstalk – NEXT** – Occurs at near end where the transmitting signal is strong, and it's picked up by adjacent pairs
        
    - **Far End Crosstalk – FEXT** – Is the noise effect at the far end that is receiving the signal
        
    
- Static discharge – The release of an electric current on the surface of two materials that have come into contact with each other and are then separated.
    
- Power source requirements, voltage levels and location
    
- Noise sources such as lighting ballasts, HVAC systems, and EMI

### Safety Precautions

Care should be taken to ensure the following safety measures are observed:

- Understand the floor plan layout, exits and locations of safety barriers
- Wear protective items such as gloves, safety glasses, and shoes
- Wear Electrostatic Discharge - ESD wrist bands or heal straps
- Locate the emergency power shutoff
- Be cautious with tools, ladders, lifts, and rigging equipment
- Check power and grounding
- Take extra care in wet floor area and stairs
- Route extension cables away from heavy traffic
- Properly discard small shards from fiber optic glass
- Take caution when working near chemicals, gases, radiation, and asbestos

# Mounts and Enclosures

## What are connectivity solutions?

In a typical AV system, key components such as audio processors, scalers, and matrix switchers are invisible to the user, often mounted in an AV rack or inside a dedicated AV/IT room. But an AV system needs accessible control and connection points for operating the system and connecting local sources. These devices might be the only components in an AV system that end users actually see.

Whether it's for button panels or cable access installation in walls, floor boxes, rack shelves, tables or lecterns, Extron offers an assortment of adapter plates, brackets, enclosures, and several hardware mounting solutions.
