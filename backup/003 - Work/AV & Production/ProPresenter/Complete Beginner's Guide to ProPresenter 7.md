> It is recommended to create new presentations per service or event, so they are more organized and contain the correct content necessary for that event.

Notice how the **PreShow**, **Music**, and **Presentation** sections are all neatly arranged and organized inside the left hand pane.

- At the bottom left of the viewer pane, you can select between **Cut**, **Dissolve** or **Custom Effect** that will determine the slide transitions.
- 
- On the bottom right of the viewer pane, slide view options are available.

	- **Grid View** displays all of the content in the item in a neat grid formation.
	- **Easy View** displays the content of the slides in an easier to read format, but retains the same functionality as grid view otherwise.
	- **Table View**: displays all the content in the item in a top-down view from first to last piece of content. 
	- The **Slider** available next to the buttons provides sizing options for each of the views.

### Preview Pane

> On the rightmost side of the program is the preview window, which displays the content that is currently being presented. 

At the top of the Preview Pane, you can enable or disable the ***Audience*** and ***Stage*** previews to see what is being displayed to the audience and from the stage, respectively. 

The dropdown under the preview lets you select between 4 options:

- **Audience**: preview what is being displayed to the audience
- **Screen**: preview what is being displayed to the screen
- **Stage***: What is being displayed on the stage
- **Stage Screen**: What is being displayed on the stage screen

> On the right side of the Preview Window, there are ***clear*** buttons.

- The tall button with the `x` will clear all content from the screen.
- The individual icons represent the different parts of the presentation that can be cleared individually. 

# Layers

> Layers are independent places where content can be shown. Layers are placed on top of each other to create the final content that we see.

- Layers can also be split to different screens to create different unique looks.

> In the clear section of the preview window, beside **clear all**, there are several buttons that represent the different layers in ProPresenter. 
> 
> 	Layers that have content will be *highlighted*, so you can tell which layers currently are displaying content.

- **Video Input Layer**: layer that displays the video content for the presentation
- **Media Layer**: represents the foreground and background media
- **Slide Layer**: the slide layer controls and displays the text that will be output for the presentation, layered over the video and media layers.
- **Announcements Layer**: functions as a separate slideshow, with it's own slide and media layers inside of it. Offers the ability to send different slides and media to different screens.
- **Props Layer**: can be used to add props to the screen
- **Messages Layer**: Can be used to add messages to the screen, similar to props.

# Show Controls

> Displays the different show controls, located underneath the Preview Window.

- **Audio Bin**: contains all the audio that accompanies the presentation.
- **Stage**: Displays all of the stage controls used by the presentation.
- **Clock**: Displays clock information, including *Segment Countdowns*, *PreShow Countdowns*, *and Game Timers*, for example.
- **Messages**: Messages for the message layer
- **Props**: Props for the prop layer.
- **Miscellaneous**

### Media Bin

> The **Media Bin** contains media content for use in presentations.

- Because the media layer operates independently from the slide layer, the background video can be changed on the fly if necessary. 
- Media can be organized into playlist folders much like the presentations in the **Library Pane**

> A ***Smart Playlist*** automatically brings in any media to ProPresenter from a folder on the computer's file system.

- Any content added to that folder will automatically be loaded into the Smart Playlist inside ProPresenter.

- The **Search** function can be accessed with `Ctrl + F`. 
	- It will bring up a search window to locate all playlists and presentations.
	- You can drag and drop from the search window into any other playlist or folders.
	- The search function is a persistent window, meaning it will appear in the program wherever it was last moved and used.
	- **SongSelect** can be accessed from here too, as long as that account is logged in. 

- The **Text** button controls formatting, and allows you to use the options in the menu to format the currently selected slides or presentations.
- **Theme**: Allows you to quickly apply a new theme to the currently selected slide(s) or presentation(s).

#### Multi-View Buttons

- **Show**: Shows the Show view. This is the view that displays the presentation information such as slides, media and other content. 
- **Edit**: Shows the edit view. 
- **Reflow**: Shows the Reflow view
- **Bible**: Shows the bible view.
- **More**: Opens a menu with access to other editors such as the Props Editor, Theme Editor and Stage Editor.

#### Feature Buttons

- **Store**: Toggles the Media store
- **Media**: Toggles the Media bin
- **Audience**: Toggles Graphics Audience Outputs
- **Stage**: Toggles Stage Graphics Outputs
- **Looks**: Toggles Which Look is active
- **Live**: Allows you to start and stop the capture, adjust capture settings, and view statistics about the current capture.

# Screen Configuration 

***Audience Screens*** are used to share content viewing the presentation in person or online.

***Stage Screens*** are meant for people working on stage or behind the scenes.

Each audience or stage screen can be set up to show multiple versions of content based on the screen.

Under **Screen** -> **Screen Configuration**, you can set up individual screens as:

- Single Screens
- Mirrored Screens
- Grouped Screens
- Edge Blended Screens

> Each of these screens needs to be connected to an output.

***NDI*** is used for sending content over the network, to things like OBS or VMix.

***Syphon*** is used to send video content from one program to another program on the same operating system.

***Placeholder Screens*** are useful for online streams, because they do not need a physical screen attached, just an output screen that can be encoded.

# Exporting a Presentation

> Select the presentation you wish to export, then go to **File** -> **Export**.

From here, there are a few different options. 

1. Presentation
2. Presentation Bundle
3. Text
4. Slide Images

The ***Presentation Bundle*** includes all media inside the presentation like images, videos.
- The file size will increase significantly with this option.

The ***Presentation*** option will include the slides and text, but no media will be included in the export. 

# Creating Playlists

> Go to **File** -> **New Playlist** to create a new playlist. 

Once the playlist is created, content can be dragged and dropped into the playlist. Alternatively, the **Search** function can be used to add content.

On the playlist viewer, clicking on the **Plus** icon can add **Headers** to the playlist. These headers are used to add breaks and organization to the playlists, and can be color-coded so they can be more easily identified visually.

# Navigating Presentations

> Using the **down arrow** will move vertically through the playlist between each entry in that playlist.

> Using the **right arrow** will move the slideshow through each slide, starting from the first slide and moving through the last slide.

- Using **left arrow** goes to the previous slide, and **spacebar** also cycles through the same slides, just like with **right arrow**. 

Slides with a **hotkey** enabled will have an icon displaying the key they are bound to, usually by section of the song.

- Chorus is bound to `C`, Verse to `S`, etc.
- You can also type in the slide number and press enter to jump to that slide directly.
	- E.g. type "10" to jump to slide #10.

# Configuring Stage Screen

> Under the preview panel, in **Stage Controls** (the little icon with the man at the podium) you can see your stage screen displays.

- By opening "edit layout" you can add new layouts to the stage screen.

If you press the "plus" icon in the top right of the **Layouts** section, you will have access to pre-built layouts for the stage screen. 

Clicking on certain sections of the Stage Screen slides will open up options related to shape, text and the size of the elements of the components on the Stage Slide. 

- There are very in depth formatting options for all the components of the Stage Screen.
