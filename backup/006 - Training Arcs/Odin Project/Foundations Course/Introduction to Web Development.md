# Introduction

What do web developers do? In short, they build and maintain websites. 

Web developers often work for clients who are trying to get their product or service onto the web. The work is typically project focused and involves collaborating with a team to coordinate the client's need into the end product. The client could be a tech company, an organization, or a government. The work could involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development.

Web development could be a good profession for you if you like solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies. Web developers are in high demand, generally have a good work-life balance, and command comfortable salaries. Google your specific location to get a better sense of your local web development job opportunities.
## Types of Web Developers

Earlier, we mentioned that web development work could be in the front end, the back end, or the full stack. What exactly do these terms mean?

The **front end** is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience. 

The **back end** refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to work with data. 

**Full-Stack Developers** are comfortable working with both the front and back ends. At the Odin Project, we focus on teaching you full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development. 
## Types of careers

Now that you know about the different types of web developers, let’s cover what we mentioned earlier about the different types of clients and employers you may work with.

Large tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, have very stringent hiring requirements. If you successfully meet these expectations, they offer excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities.

Startups are a bit like the wild west. For a junior developer, it can feel like a trial by fire because of the pace of development. Startups often offer slightly lower salaries and require longer hours, but they may also offer equity in the company and highly unique environments.

As a freelancer, you could command a strong hourly wage and the freedom to schedule and design your own products. However, you would be responsible for getting your own work (which means less coding time), managing billing from clients (which can be difficult), and being solely responsible. Strong people skills are necessary for this path.

As a consultant for a web consultancy, you would give up some of your freelancing wage potential but be able to focus more on the code and less on the hustle. This option also provides a good work-life balance and pay.

Finally, large, older companies still need web developers. These companies offer a good work-life balance, pay, and benefits but often move slower than a company that is highly focused on tech.
## Tools of the Trade

These are some of the tools you will use regularly. You may not know what they are now, but you most certainly will going forward.

- Computer
- Google
- Text Editor
- Command Line Interface
- Stack Overflow
- Git
- Github
## Motivation

Learning to code is incredibly rewarding by can also be difficult and frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are a *desire to build*, a *problem-solving mind*, and *persistence in the*
*face of setbacks*.

The web development industry has a long history of successful developers with varying backgrounds, so people tend to care more about what you've actually *built* than how you got there.
## Why Odin?

We want you to know that this will not be easy.

There are plenty of other online curriculums for beginners, but they are often taught in an extremely isolated and controlled environment and cover only a specific topic.

The Odin Project takes a realistic view of what you need to know and has you set up and work in your own environment, much like what you’ll be doing when you get a job.

It acknowledges that you need a wide variety of skill sets and languages to reach an employable level.

The Odin Project is constantly evolving because of people like you who get further along in the curriculum and pay it forward by incrementally improving our content over time.

Once you start to feel comfortable with the tools, start contributing to open source projects, like [contributing to The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/contributing)! The more you contribute, the more you will learn about what you can do, and the closer you will get to being hireable. These projects will also look great on your resume
## Conclusion

Hopefully, you’ve gained a better idea of what a web developer actually does and what your life might look like if you decided to take it on as a career. This has only been a teaser into the world of web development.

In this “Foundations” course, you’ll take a journey through the entire spectrum of topics that you will eventually need to know. This course jumps around to a variety of topics that you may be totally unfamiliar with, providing you a small taste of each and then moving on.

The following courses will dive deep into these topics. You will build dozens of scripts, projects, and websites to cement those skills that will get you hired.

Yes, it’s going to be challenging.

But it’s also going to be fun.

And it might even be life-changing.

# Motivation
## Introduction

Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. Like any skill worth knowing, it takes time to acquire, and it can't be learned in a weekend or even a month. With that said, we believe anyone can learn how to program as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort. 

So before we get into the meat of the curriculum, we'll cover the following aspects to help you get the most out of the Odin Project: factors that will help you succeed in learning to code and the pitfalls that you should try to avoid.
## Motivation

Take a moment to think about why you have decided to learn programming.

- Do you want to have a fulfilling career that pays well?
- Are you excited by the creative outlet programming provides?
- Are you determined to develop the skills and abilities to build any app you can think of?
- Do you want to start your own company by turning an app idea into a reality?

Your motivation could be a combination of these reasons or something else entirely. Whatever it is, hold on tightly to your motivation - this will be what pulls you through to the end of this journey, giving you a definitive goal to aim towards.
## Growth Mindset

Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself *any* new skills, not just programming. Your mindset will have more of an impact on your chances of success than just about anything else. 

Someone with the **fixed mindset** believes if they don't get something on their first attempt, they never will. They believe that they aren't smart enough to be able to do or understand some things. 

However, there is a wide body of research showing that intelligence is not fixed but can instead be developed. Someone with the **growth mindset** believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence. 

What does this mean for you? It means you can learn new skills and develop new talents with **persistence and grit**.

There will be many times throughout the Odin Project that you will get stuck on a concept or a programming problem and may find yourself questioning your ability to learn programming. When you find yourself in this position, remind yourself that you may not get it *yet* but that with persistence and grit you will. Struggling with something is growth. It doesn't matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through. That's how real learning happens.

While you're working through the curriculum, embrace the struggles you encounter with difficult concepts and complex projects. Be sure to celebrate your persistence in overcoming those struggles!

When you find yourself questioning your abilities, reflect on the successes you have achieved while learning to program: the projects you have completed and the concepts you once didn't understand but now do. This is all the proof that you need that your can do it.
## The Learning Process

Learning concepts and then practicing them will help you more fully understand how things work and fit together. Projects are the ultimate method for ensuring that your theoretical understanding aligns with how the programming concepts and techniques actually operate.

When learning, your mind will consistently switch between focus mode and diffuse mode. **Focus mode** occurs when your are consciously focusing on learning, reading, watching videos or working on a project. **Diffuse mode** occurs subconsciously, at times when you are not actively learning, such as when you're doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping. In this state, your mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the other things you know. ***This is where breakthroughs happen***.

It's important to know that your mind goes through these two states when learning because you can utilize this to make your learning more efficient. When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a solution to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break.

In short, understand it, practice it, and finally teach it. 

Teaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learned and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you wouldn't have identified otherwise. 

You can practice this method of learning by helping others in the community.
## What to Do When You're Stuck

You will inevitably get stuck at some point in the curriculum, perhaps due to a concept that you are having difficulty understanding or perhaps due to something not working correctly in a project. Whatever it is, use the following tools to get unstuck:

- Google it: You can be certain someone else out there has encountered the same problem as you at some point. A quick Google search can often lead to a solution.
- Take a break: Allow your diffuse learning state to work on the problem.
- Ask for help in the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/theodinproject); come prepared with your research. People will be more willing to help you when they can see you have already put effort into trying to figure out the solution on your own.

Additionally, feel free to follow the diagram below to help you navigate problems that you may come across:

## A Note on AI Code Generation

As technology advances, we have seen some incredible tools emerge that can help accelerate coding capacity. One particular area that has exploded in popularity lately is the usage of large language models, and generative AIs for code completion (Github Copilot) and code generation (ChatGPT).

While these tools are amazing, learners should be aware of the impacts that using such tools can have on core competency. David Humphrey, a computer science professor, [wrote about ChatGPT and its potentially negative impacts on core learning.](https://blog.humphd.org/cheatgpt/). It is a good read about the pitfalls of using generative AI in an educational context. 

For learners who are new to programming, tools like ChatGPT or Github Copilot can result in blindspots and gaps in your knowledge.

1. By using a generative AI, learners may miss the opportunity to discover how something works and *why* things are done that way.
2. Asking good questions is an important skill, and relying on generative AI instead of asking people (like Discord communities) can delay the development of this skill.
3. Learning to talk about the code that one writes is another important skill. In a professional environment, it is highly likely that you will be doing code reviews where you have to explain the how and why behind what you are presenting. 
4. As David Humphrey mentions, the output of generative AI must be closely scrutinized, and learners who are new to programming generally don't have a good overall understanding to be able to determine if the output is good or bad.
5. While learning how to provide good prompts to an AI tool is a skill, it is **supplementary** to developing foundational programming skills.
6. AI tools are designed to answer questions and are not designed to help learners develop research and problem solving skills. If you ask an AI for information, it will provide information for you. If you ask a human, they may invite you to share your understanding of the problem and offer some guidance on how to discover a solution.
7. Without practice in research, problem solving and critical thinking, interviews could be a struggle since it is very likely that applicants would not be allowed to use AI tools.
## Managing Your Study Time

You will have more success with Odin by putting **consistent** time into it rather than working on it once a week. Building a habit of studying every day at a specific time and with a specific goal will ensure that you make consistent progress.

It may take you longer than others to grasp concepts, or it may take you less time. This doesn’t mean you’re smarter or dumber than others, it means you’ve had differing life experiences that may or may not have prepared you for learning those concepts. Someone who grew up around an engineer may have some advantages over someone who didn’t, but it doesn’t mean you can’t learn those skills.

The Odin Project isn’t like college or university, it is self-paced and allows you to get a solid grasp of concepts before moving on. In school, you’re forced to keep up, or you will fail. The difference with The Odin Project is that you’re not expected to have much prior knowledge; there are no prerequisites. We’ve had people be successful coming through here who only knew how to check their email with a computer. We’ve also seen success from computer science degree holders. Treating The Odin Project like a static timeline is understandable, but is a sign of misplaced expectations. You don’t know what you don’t know yet, and that’s OK! There are no due-dates on lessons in The Odin Project, so you can spend enough time to do it right and discuss the topics.

Deadlines cause unneeded stress. Since The Odin Project is a free and open platform, you are not beholden to a deadline. Creating your own deadlines can lead to rushing through concepts that should not be rushed. This course is very research based, meaning you will have to do research to complete tasks and projects. There’s no guarantee you will find the right article or post quickly enough to meet your deadlines, but you will likely learn a TON along the way that you can use in the future. People that do this kind of research and strive to write better solutions tend to become better developers in the future. There’s no way to know how long it will take you to learn how to query concepts to find your answers. There are no solid guidelines on that. If you’re doing The Odin Project because you need a high-paying job _right now_, you’re unlikely to become a solid developer within the timeframe you have set. Stress and anxiety absolutely do not help you learn either. Relax and just enjoy the ride.

Long story short: Don’t worry, just go learn!
## Pitfalls to Avoid

The following are some of the pitfalls that beginners often encounter when learning how to program. Try your best to avoid these.
### Procrastination

Procrastination will be your biggest enemy when trying to make progress.

> [!Warning] Solution
> The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused. The idea is to set a timer for 25 minutes and to work on a task until the timer goes off. If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25 minutes, the 25 minutes of work start over again. Once you've successfully focused on work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. When your break is over, repeat the 25 minutes of work and 5 minute break. After you've completed four 25 minute blocks of work, take a longer 15-30 minute break.
> 
> The Pomodoro technique is great for avoiding procrastination as it forces you to work without distractions. Since the work time only lasts 25 minutes before taking a break, it's not overwhelming, making it harder to rationalize procrastination.
> 
> If you want to try it out, [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/) is a customizable pomodoro timer that works on desktop & mobile browser.

### Not Taking Breaks

As you get into the material, you may feel compelled to continuously study for long periods of time. It might seem like you are getting more work done at first, but this often leads to burnout, which consequently results in lower productivity. 

It may seem counter-intuitive, but you will actually get more done if you regularly step back to recharge your brain and body. Studies shown that performance increases after breaks of all durations: from extended vacations down to microbreaks of 30 seconds. 

John Trougakos, Associate Professor of Management at the University of Toronto, says that mental concentration is similar to a muscle. Our focus becomes fatigued after sustained use and needs a rest period to recover, just like a bodybuilder resting between sets at the gym.

> [!Warning] Solution
> Use the previously mentioned Pomodoro technique to time how often and how long to take your well deserved breaks. Feel free to play around and experiment with different frequencies and durations of breaks.

What to do during your break:

- Listen to music.
- Journal
- Doodle
- Meditate
- Play a quick game.
- Go for a short walk outside.

Check out this article for [more information on breaks & productivity](https://simpleprogrammer.com/taking-breaks-will-boost-productivity/).
### Digital Distractions

Digital distractions are email and Facebook notifications and time-wasting websites, such as social media. These distractions break your focus and attention and make procrastination tempting. Therefore, they should be avoided during study time. 

> [!Warning] Solution
> Turn off notifications and add a blocker to your internet to limit your time on distracting sites.
### Physical Distractions

Physical distractions are distractions from your environment, like a TV in the background or other people talking. These distractions can be just as damaging to your focus as digital distractions.

> [!Warning] Solution
> Find a quiet place in your home where you can focus on your studies. If that’s not an option, you can use noise cancelling headphones to block out noisy distractions in your environment. There are also complimentary public and university libraries that are serene and comfortable. Some libraries even operate 24/7, uninterrupted. Beyond just providing a pleasant study space, the presence of others studying around you instills a sense of productivity.
### Rabbit Holes

Because we cover so much material on the Odin Project and link to so many high quality courses and tools, it is easy for students to get pulled into rabbit holes by spending time trying to learn all there is to know about a subject that they aren't ready for or won't benefit from much. **We have put a lot of effort into the curriculum** so that all of the important things that you need to know about web development are covered when you need to know them.

> [!Warning] Solution
> Stick to the path laid out as much as possible. Try to limit time spent going down rabbit holes, as these sidetracks can really really ruin momentum.
### Comparing Oneself to Others

Students often compare themselves to others who are farther along in their coding journey and have more experience. This is a recipe for depression and frustration.

> [!Warning] Solution
> Only compare yourself to your past self. Have your abilities and knowledge improved from where you were last week, last month or last year? Be proud of the progress you've made!
### Counterproductive Note-taking

The Odin Project does not recommend taking a lot of notes throughout your web development educational journey because it can be time consuming and often leads to wasted effort. 

> [!Warning] Solution
> Instead of taking notes to use as direct references, make notes that can serve as prompts for further research. It is important to get comfortable with reading documentation, which essentially acts as pre-existing notes made by someone else.
## Conclusion

Learning any new skill is a journey full of speed bumps and obstacles to overcome. We hope that the principles laid out here will put you in a much better position to succeed and get the most out of The Odin Project.

# Asking For Help

## Introduction

Along your programming journey, you will inevitably need to ask questions in an online coding community like ours or in conversations with your colleagues. While asking questions may seem rather simple, in a programming environment it is essential to ask well-formed questions with as much context as needed so you can get the most out of asking for help. In essence, “help others help you!” This lesson will provide you with the tools to effectively ask questions in communities such as our Discord chat, Stack Overflow, and in the workplace!
## Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Explain techniques for asking programming questions.
- Explain and avoid qualities of “bad” questions.
- Ask effective and well-formed questions.
## Tips for getting the best help possible

## Always provide your code and the surrounding context

When asking a question, it is essential to provide your code, error message, terminal command, server output, and other relevant details. You should provide as much context as possible and zero in on the specific problem, such as pointing people to a specific function or line number in your code. Providing this relevant information makes it easier for others to help you.

If your question does not provide any code or other relevant information, it will be difficult for others to help you. In order to fully understand your question, there will be a lot of unnecessary back and forth conversation. This can be discouraging for you because any answers with incomplete information will not solve your problem. This process can be frustrating for those helping because the meaning of your original question changes as you add more context to it. If you truly want to ask a conceptual question, you should indicate this as part of your question.
## Ask about the problem at hand, not the solution itself)

A lot of learners ask exactly how to approach a given task or assignment in this curriculum, such as the following:

- “How do I complete Step 5 of the Rock Paper Scissors Assignment”?

Keep in mind that you’re supposed to figure out how to solve the assignments yourself, and figuring out an approach is essential to your learning journey. A much better question might look like this:

- “Hey, I’m trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I’m getting a syntax error on line 12. How can I fix this? Here’s my code.”

In sharing your attempt, people know what you’ve tried and won’t suggest things that might not have worked out for you. It also allows them to debug your current iteration of code, rather than sending you down a path that has you start all over again when you might be very close to a solution.

Now, if you’re completely stuck with where to start, it’s completely fine to let people know that you’re stuck. Asking where you can start and what you can research to get on the right track empowers you to be able to resolve issues largely on your own in the future, and might even empower you to help others with the same issue later on. It is also recommended that you share your pseudo code so people can nudge you in the right direction or correct any misunderstandings you may have.
## Don’t take asking for more context to heart

People who volunteer in coding communities are here to help! A question you may feel is coherent and “obvious” probably isn’t if you are being asked for more context. While something may seem “obvious” to a beginner, it’s sometimes nowhere near “obvious” to an expert. An expert knows about many, many more situations that could cause an issue someone is experiencing, and would want to refrain from sending a learner down the wrong path. People take time out of their day to help, so make it as easy as possible for them to help you! There’s probably a good reason why they need more information, so trust their judgment and experience when they ask. Many people who help in coding chats are unpaid volunteers, and are in no way obligated to answer your query. But because they truly want to help you, they will ask for more information when needed!
### Assignment

1. [Don’t ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/) demonstrates the importance of just asking your question and not asking to ask your question.
2. Read about the [“XY Problem”](https://xyproblem.info/), which is a common pitfall both new and experienced programmers fall into when asking questions.
3. Read and bookmark our community guide [How to Ask Technical Questions](https://www.theodinproject.com/guides/community/how_to_ask). It is a great reference to refer to whenever you find yourself needing to ask for help, and you might find yourself solving your own problem as you think about the points listed in the article.
### Knowledge check

The following questions are an opportunity to reflect on key topics in this lesson. If you can’t answer a question, click on it to review the material, but keep in mind you are not expected to memorize or master this knowledge.
