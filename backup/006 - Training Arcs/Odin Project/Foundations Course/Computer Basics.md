# What is an Operating System?

Your computer's **Operating System** manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need access to your computer's **central processing unit**, **memory** and **storage**. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.
## Types of Operating Systems

Operating systems typically come **pre-loaded** on any computer that you buy. Most people use each operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are **Microsoft Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

 Modern operating systems use a **graphical user interface**, or **GUI**. A GUI lets you use your mouse to click **icons**, **buttons** and **menus**, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of **graphics and text**.

Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating system it may seem unfamiliar at first. However, modern operating systems are designed to be **easy to use**, and most of the basic principles are the same.
### Microsoft Windows

Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980's. There have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are **Windows 10** (released in 2015), **Windows 8** (2012), **Windows 7** (2009), and **Windows Vista** (2007). Windows comes **pre-loaded** on most new PCs, which helps to make it the **most popular operating system** in the world.

Check out our tutorials on [Windows Basics](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windowsbasics) and [specific Windows versions](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/topics/windows/) for more information.
### macOS

**macOS** (previously called **OS X**) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs. Some of the specific versions include **Mojave** (released in 2018), **High Sierra** (2017), and **Sierra** (2016).

According to [StatCounter Global Stats](http://gs.statcounter.com/), macOS users account for less than **10%** of global operating systems—much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more than **80%**). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.

Check out our [macOS Basics](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/macosbasics/) tutorial for more information.
### Linux

**Linux** (pronounced **LINN-ux**) is a family of **open-source** operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This is different from **proprietary software** like Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is **free**, and there are many different **distributions**—or versions—you can choose from.

According to [StatCounter Global Stats](http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-ww-monthly-201202-201301), Linux users account for less than **2%** of global operating systems. However, most **servers** run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.

To learn more about different distributions of Linux, visit the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), and [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) websites, or refer to our [Linux Resources](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/topics/linux/). For a more comprehensive list, you can visit MakeUseOf's list of [The Best Linux Distributions](http://www.makeuseof.com/pages/best-linux-distributions).
## Operating Systems for Mobile Devices

The operating systems we've been talking about so far were designed to run on **desktop** and **laptop** computers. **Mobile devices** such as **phones**, **tablet computers**, and **MP3 players** are different from desktop and laptop computers, so they run operating systems that are designed specifically for mobile devices. Examples of mobile operating systems include **Apple iOS** and **Google Android**. In the screenshot below, you can see iOS running on an iPad.

Operating systems for mobile devices generally aren't as fully featured as those made for desktop and laptop computers, and they aren't able to run all of the same software. However, you can still do a lot of things with them, like watch movies, browse the Web, manage your calendar, and play games.

# What is an Application?

You may have heard people talking about using a **program**, an **application**, or an **app**. But what exactly does that mean? Simply put, an **app** is a type of software that allows you to **perform specific tasks**. Applications for desktop or laptop computers are sometimes called **desktop applications**, while those for mobile devices are called **mobile apps**.

When you open an application, it runs inside the **operating system** until you close it. Most of the time, you will have more than one application open at the same time, which is known as **multi-tasking**.

**App** is a common term for an **application**, especially for **simple applications** that can be downloaded **inexpensively** or even **for free**. Many apps are also available for **mobile devices** and even some **TVs**.
## Desktop Applications

There are countless desktop applications, and they fall into several categories. Some are more **full featured** (like **Microsoft Word**), while others may only do **one or two things** (like a **clock** or **calendar** app). Below are just a few types of applications you might use.

- **Word processors**: A word processor allows you to write a letter, design a flyer, and create many other types of documents. The most well-known word processor is **Microsoft Word**.
- **Web browsers**: A **web browser** is the tool you use to access the **Internet**. Most computers come with a web browser **pre-installed**, but you can also download a different one if you prefer. Examples of browsers include **Internet Explorer**, **Mozilla** **Firefox**, **Google Chrome**, and **Safari**.
- **Media players**: If you want to listen to **MP3s** or watch **movies** you've downloaded, you'll need to use a **media player**. **Windows Media Player** and **iTunes** are popular media players.- 
- **Games**: There are many types of games you can play on your computer. They range from card games like **Solitaire** to action games like **Halo**. Many action games require a lot of **computing power**, so they may not work unless you have a newer computer.
## Mobile Apps

Desktop and laptop computers aren't the only devices that can run applications. You can also download apps for mobile devices like **smartphones** and **tablets**. Here are a few examples of mobile apps.

- **Gmail**: You can use the Gmail app to easily view and send emails from your mobile device. It's available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480) devices.
- **Instagram**: You can use Instagram to quickly share photos with your friends and family. It's available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/instagram/id389801252).
- **Duolingo**: With a combination of quizzes, games, and other activities, this app can help you learn new languages. It's available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128?mt=8).
## Installing New Applications

Every computer and mobile device will come with some applications already built in, such as a web browser and media player. However, you can also purchase and install new apps to add more functionality. You can review our lessons on [Installing Software on Your Windows PC](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/basic-computer-skills/installing-software-on-your-windows-pc/1/), [Installing Software on Your Mac](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/basic-computer-skills/installing-software-on-your-mac/1/), and [Free Software](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/basic-computer-skills/free-software/1/) to learn more.
